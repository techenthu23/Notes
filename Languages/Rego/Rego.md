# Rego

Rego is a high-level, declarative query language used by the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to define policies. It was inspired by Datalog and extends it to support structured document models like JSON¹².

## How Rego Works
Rego allows you to write policies as code, focusing on **what** the policy should achieve rather than **how** to achieve it. Here’s a brief overview of its key features:

1. **Declarative Nature**: You describe the desired state or outcome, and Rego figures out the steps to achieve it³.
2. **Policy as Code**: Rego enables you to define policies that can be version-controlled and modular, similar to other code².
3. **Data Inspection and Transformation**: Rego queries inspect and transform data in structured documents, allowing OPA to make policy decisions⁴.

## Example
Here’s a simple example of a Rego rule that allows only a user named "alice" to create and delete virtual networks:

```rego
allow := true {
  input.user == "alice"
}
```

In this example, the rule checks if the `input.user` is "alice" and sets `allow` to `true` if the condition is met².

# How do I integrate Rego with my application?
Integrating Rego with your application involves using the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce policies written in Rego. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

## 1. **Install OPA**
First, you need to install OPA. You can download it from the [OPA GitHub releases page](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) or use a package manager like Homebrew:


```sh
brew install opa
```

## 2. **Write Rego Policies**
Create your Rego policies. For example, you might have a policy file `example.rego`:

```rego
package example

default allow = false

allow {
  input.user == "alice"
}
```

## 3. **Run OPA as a Server**
Start the OPA server to evaluate policies. You can run OPA in server mode using:

```sh
opa run --server
```

## 4. **Load Policies and Data**
You can load your policies and data into OPA using the REST API. For example, to load the `example.rego` policy:

```sh
curl -X PUT --data-binary @example.rego http://localhost:8181/v1/policies/example
```

## 5. **Query OPA from Your Application**
Your application can query OPA to make policy decisions. Here’s an example using `curl` to check if a user is allowed:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8181/v1/data/example/allow -d '{"input": {"user": "alice"}}'
```

## 6. **Integrate with Your Application Code**
In your application code, you can use HTTP requests to query OPA. Here’s an example in Python:

```python
import requests

def check_policy(user):
    url = "http://localhost:8181/v1/data/example/allow"
    input_data = {"input": {"user": user}}
    response = requests.post(url, json=input_data)
    result = response.json()
    return result["result"]

# Example usage
user = "alice"
if check_policy(user):
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Access denied")
```

## 7. **Deploy OPA**
Deploy OPA alongside your application, ensuring it has access to the necessary policies and data.
