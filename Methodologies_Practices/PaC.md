A ___policy___ is a set of rules that governs the behavior of a service. ___Policy enablement___ empowers users to read, write, and manage these rules without needing specialized development or operational expertise. When your users can implement policies without recompiling your source code, then your service is policy enabled.

Policy-as-code is an approach to policy management in which policies are defined, updated, shared, and enforced using code. By leveraging code-based automation instead of relying on manual processes to manage policies, policy-as-code allows teams to move more quickly and reduce the potential for mistakes due to human error.

At the same time, a policy-as-code approach to domains like security makes it possible to define and manage policies in ways that different types of stakeholders – such as developers and security engineers – can understand.

In this context, a policy is any type of rule, condition, or instruction that governs IT operations or processes. A policy could be a rule that defines which conditions must be met in order for a code to pass a security control and be deployed, for example. Or, it could be a set of procedures that are executed automatically in response to a security event.

Policy-as-code is the use of code to define and manage rules and conditions. Under a policy-as-code approach, teams write out policies using some type of programming language, such as Python, YAML, or Rego. The specific language usually depends on which policy-as-code management and enforcement tools you are using.

When engineers need to make updates, they do so by modifying the existing code. They can also share the code with others to give them visibility into their policies using version control systems (VCS). And, last but not least, they can use a policy-as-code enforcement engine to ensure policies are met. An enforcement engine may be a standalone policy-as-code code, or it could be built into a larger platform.

# Policy-as-Code vs. Infrastructure as Code

The concept of policy-as-code may sound similar to Infrastructure as Code, or IaC. IaC, which uses code-based files to automate infrastructure setup and provisioning, has been a common practice for IT operations teams for years.

Whereas IaC is beneficial to IT operations teams who need to provision infrastructure, policy-as-code can improve security operations, compliance management, data management, and far beyond.

For implementing Policy as Code (PaC), you can leverage frameworks that provide a structured approach for defining, enforcing, and managing policies in a code-like manner. One widely used framework for PaC is the Open Policy Agent (OPA). OPA is a general-purpose policy engine with a rich set of features and integrations. Here's an overview of how OPA serves as a framework for Policy as Code:

# Benefits of Policy-as-Code

- __Efficiency__: When policies are spelled out as code, they can be shared and enforced automatically at virtually unlimited scale. This is much more efficient than requiring engineers to enforce a policy manually each time it becomes necessary to do so. Updating and sharing policies are also more efficient when the policies are defined in clear, concise code rather than being described in human language that some engineers may interpret differently than others.

- __Speed__: The ability to automate policy enforcement also means that policy-as-code results in faster operations than a manual approach.

- __Visibility__: When policies are defined in code, it’s easy for all stakeholders to use the code to understand what is happening within a system. They can review alerting or remediation rules simply by checking which code-based policies are in place, for example, instead of having to ask other engineers and wait for a response.

- __Collaboration__: By providing a uniform, systematic means of managing policies, policy-as-code simplifies collaboration. This includes collaboration not just within the same team, but also between different types of teams – especially between developers (who are accustomed to thinking and working in terms of code) and specialists in other domains, like security or IT operations.

- __Accuracy__: When teams define and manage policies using code, they avoid the risk of making configuration mistakes when managing a system manually.

- __Version control__: If you keep track of different versions of your policy files as they change, policy-as-code ensures that you can revert to an earlier configuration easily in the event that a new policy version creates a problem.

- __Testing and validation__: When policies are written in code, it’s easy to validate them using automated auditing tools. In this way, policy-as-code can help reduce the risk of introducing critical errors into production environments.

# How to Use Policy-As-Code

The easiest way to take advantage of policy-as-code today is to adopt tools that natively support policy-as-code for whichever domain you want to manage via a policy-as-code approach.

For example, in the realm of security, __Prisma Cloud__, __Bridgecrew__, and __Checkov__ allow teams to define security policies using code. They can also automatically scan and audit policy files in order to detect misconfigurations or vulnerabilities prior to deployment. This approach is one way that these tools streamline cloud security posture management.

You may also want to explore tools like __Open Policy Agent__, which aims to provide a common framework for applying policy-as-code to any domain. To date, however, vendor adoption of community-based policy-as-code frameworks like this remains limited, which is why seeking out vendor tools with native policy-as-code support is the simplest path toward implementing a policy-as-code approach to security or any other IT domain.

When planning to implement Policy as Code (PaC), it's crucial to carefully assess your organization's needs, infrastructure, and specific policy requirements. Here's a structured plan to help you figure out the best tools for implementing PaC:

1. __Understand Policy Requirements:__
   - Identify the specific policies your organization needs to enforce.
   - Consider compliance standards, security requirements, and operational policies.

2. __Assess Infrastructure:__
   - Evaluate your existing infrastructure, including cloud providers, on-premises systems, and any other relevant environments.
   - Determine the types of resources (e.g., servers, containers, databases) that need policy enforcement.

3. __Define Scope and Granularity:__
   - Determine the scope of policies—whether they apply globally, to specific projects, or to certain environments.
   - Define the granularity of policies—whether they need to be applied at the infrastructure, application, or data level.

4. __Select Appropriate Tools:__
   - Choose tools that align with your infrastructure and policy needs.
   - Consider tools that integrate well with your existing systems, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud providers.

5. __Evaluate General Policy Engines:__
   - Explore general-purpose policy engines like Open Policy Agent (OPA), which can be adapted to various use cases.
   - Consider the expressiveness, flexibility, and integrations offered by the chosen policy engine.

6. __Consider Specific Use Case Tools:__
   - If you have specific use cases (e.g., Kubernetes policies, IaC validation), explore tools tailored for those purposes (e.g., Kyverno for Kubernetes policies, Terrascan for IaC validation).

7. __Assess Ease of Use:__
   - Consider the ease of writing, testing, and maintaining policies in the selected tools.
   - Evaluate the learning curve for your team.

8. __Check Community and Documentation:__
   - Assess the community support and activity around the tools.
   - Review documentation for clarity, examples, and tutorials.

9. __Integration Capabilities:__
   - Ensure that the selected tools can integrate seamlessly with your existing tools, platforms, and CI/CD pipelines.

10. __Scalability:__

- Consider the scalability of the tools to handle the size and complexity of your infrastructure.

11. __Security and Compliance:__

- Verify that the tools adhere to security best practices.
- Ensure compliance with any relevant regulatory requirements.

12. __Testing and Verification:__

- Implement a testing strategy for policies to ensure they behave as expected.
- Consider tools that provide testing capabilities, like OPA-Playground for Open Policy Agent.

13. __Pilot Deployment:__

- Start with a pilot deployment in a controlled environment to validate the effectiveness of the chosen tools and policies.

14. __Feedback Loop and Iteration:__

- Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders to gather insights and refine policies.
- Iterate on your PaC implementation based on real-world experiences.

15. __Documentation and Training:__

- Provide documentation and training for your team on using the chosen tools effectively.

By following this plan, you'll be better equipped to select the right tools for your Policy as Code implementation, ensuring alignment with your organization's policies, infrastructure, and operational requirements.
