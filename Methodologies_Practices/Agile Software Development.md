Agile Development Model is based on iterative and incremental development approach in a highly collaborative manner to produce high quality software in a cost effective and timely manner which allows the project to adapt the changes quickly. 

Agile methodologies stresses on delivering the smallest working piece of functionality as early as possible and constantly improving it and adding additional functionality throughout the project lifecycle. 

Agile helps in minimizing and mitigating the overall risk, and allows the project to adapt to changes quickly and does not require a requirements freeze upfront unlike waterfall model. Work is carried out in iterations, which typically last one to six weeks. 

The industry mostly opts for agile development process as it is highly result oriented. Agile methods emphasize effective communication over written documents. The Project requirements are well documented upfront. Then, depending upon business priority, these features are assigned to releases, which are tied to iterations. Agile methods emphasize working software as the primary measure of progress. The key characteristics of the agile methodology are delivering frequently, incremental and iterative approach, less defects, continuous testing and integration, collaborative approach and maximum ROI. 

Although, there are many success stories of using Agile in software development project in last decade but knowledge of implementing these practices in a particular project is very scared. Therefore, this publication aims to systematically review the existing literature on agile software development techniques and to understand the features, benefits and challenges of using various agile techniques. 

This paper also provides the benefits, limitations of Agile Software Development and recommends when to use them.
