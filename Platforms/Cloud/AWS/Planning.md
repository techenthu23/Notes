Planning and implementing a secure network infrastructure in AWS involves a methodical process to design, deploy, and manage resources. Below is a step-by-step approach to creating and securing VPCs, subnets, and network controls in AWS:


---

1. Understand Application Requirements

Identify the application's network and security requirements.

Determine the type of workload (e.g., web applications, databases) and its traffic flow (inbound, outbound).

Define compliance and regulatory needs.



---

2. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step: Use AWS Management Console, CLI, or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.

Best Practices:

Use an IP address range (CIDR block) that doesn’t overlap with existing on-premises networks (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

Enable DNS resolution and hostnames for easier service discovery.




---

3. Design Subnets

Step: Divide the VPC into subnets based on application tiers (e.g., public, private, and isolated subnets).

Best Practices:

Place public-facing resources (like Load Balancers) in public subnets.

Place internal resources (like databases and application servers) in private subnets.

Use isolated subnets for sensitive workloads with no internet access.

Distribute subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability.




---

4. Configure Internet Gateway (IGW)

Step: Attach an IGW to the VPC for outbound internet access from public subnets.

Security Controls:

Ensure only public-facing resources (like NAT Gateways) have routes to the IGW.

Use Security Groups and NACLs to filter traffic.




---

5. Configure Route Tables

Step: Create route tables for each subnet type (public, private, isolated).

Best Practices:

Associate public subnets with a route to the IGW.

Associate private subnets with a route to a NAT Gateway (for internet-bound traffic from private resources).

Isolate internal or restricted subnets with no internet routes.




---

6. Set Up Security Groups (SGs)

Step: Create SGs for specific workloads.

Best Practices:

Allow only necessary traffic (e.g., port 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS, port 22 for SSH).

Restrict access to known IP ranges or trusted services.

Use SGs for stateful traffic control.




---

7. Configure Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

Step: Set up NACLs at the subnet level.

Best Practices:

Use NACLs to add an additional stateless layer of security.

Deny all traffic by default and allow specific traffic rules.

Be cautious of overlaps between SGs and NACLs.




---

8. Deploy and Configure NAT Gateway (NGW)

Step: Deploy a NAT Gateway for private subnets to access the internet securely.

Security Controls:

Place NAT Gateways in public subnets.

Ensure private subnets route internet-bound traffic through NAT Gateways.




---

9. Implement Endpoint Services

Step: Configure VPC endpoints for private connections to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).

Best Practices:

Use Interface Endpoints for service-specific access.

Use Gateway Endpoints for S3 or DynamoDB access.

Disable public access for AWS services when using endpoints.




---

10. Enable Monitoring and Logging

Step: Use AWS monitoring tools like CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and CloudTrail.

Best Practices:

Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture network traffic for analysis.

Monitor changes to security configurations using CloudTrail.

Set up alerts for unusual activity or policy violations.




---

11. Integrate Security Services

Step: Use AWS services to enhance security.

Best Practices:

AWS WAF: Protect against web application attacks.

AWS Shield: Mitigate DDoS attacks.

AWS GuardDuty: Detect suspicious activity in your environment.

AWS Inspector: Automate vulnerability assessments.




---

12. Validate Network Security

Perform penetration tests or vulnerability scans.

Test for least privilege access policies.

Conduct regular audits of security group and NACL configurations.



---

By following this approach, you ensure that your AWS network is securely designed, implemented, and monitored, aligning with best practices and compliance requirements.



When designing and implementing AWS VPCs, subnets, and security controls, you need to consider several restrictions and limitations. These constraints are imposed by AWS architecture and services, as well as best practices. Here’s a breakdown:


---

VPC Limits and Restrictions

1. CIDR Block Size:

Minimum size: /28 (16 IP addresses).

Maximum size: /16 (65,536 IP addresses).

Limitation: You cannot resize a VPC CIDR block after creation, but you can add secondary CIDR blocks.



2. Number of VPCs:

Default limit: 5 per region.

Consideration: Can be increased by submitting a service quota increase request.



3. Peering Connections:

A VPC can have a maximum of 125 peering connections.

Limitation: Peered VPCs cannot have overlapping CIDR blocks.



4. Endpoint Limits:

Interface Endpoints (powered by PrivateLink) have per-VPC quotas.

Maximum Gateway Endpoints: 20 per VPC (S3 and DynamoDB).





---

Subnet Limits and Restrictions

1. IP Address Allocation:

AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in every subnet (first 4 and last).

Ensure subnet size accounts for this reservation, especially for small subnets.



2. Number of Subnets:

Default limit: 200 subnets per VPC.

Consideration: This can be increased upon request.



3. Availability Zones:

Subnets must be tied to a single Availability Zone.

Best Practice: Spread subnets across multiple zones for redundancy.



4. IPv6 CIDR Block:

Subnets must be explicitly associated with an IPv6 CIDR block if IPv6 is required.





---

Route Table Restrictions

1. Number of Route Tables:

Default limit: 200 route tables per VPC.

Consideration: One main route table is automatically created for each VPC.



2. Route Entries:

Maximum of 100 routes per route table, including propagated routes.

Use summarization for CIDR blocks to optimize route table entries.



3. Inter-VPC Communication:

No transitive routing via VPC Peering.

To achieve transitive routing, use Transit Gateway or AWS Direct Connect.





---

Security Group Restrictions

1. Number of Rules:

Inbound/Outbound Rules: 60 each (can be increased to 120).

Per Instance/ENI: A maximum of 16 security groups (can be increased to 30).



2. Referencing Limits:

Security groups can reference other security groups within the same region but not across regions or VPCs (unless peered).



3. Stateful Nature:

Security groups are stateful; if traffic is allowed in one direction, return traffic is automatically allowed.





---

NACL Restrictions

1. Number of Rules:

Limit: 20 rules per ACL (inbound and outbound combined, can be increased to 40).

NACLs are stateless, so both directions of traffic must be explicitly allowed.



2. Scope:

NACLs are subnet-specific, and each subnet can only associate with one NACL at a time.



3. Evaluation Order:

Rules are processed in number order, and the first match determines the action.





---

NAT Gateway Restrictions

1. Number of NAT Gateways:

Limit: 5 NAT Gateways per Availability Zone.

A NAT Gateway cannot span multiple AZs.



2. Cost:

NAT Gateway incurs charges for data processed and hours of usage.



3. Bandwidth:

NAT Gateway provides up to 45 Gbps of bandwidth, which might not suffice for extremely high workloads.





---

AWS Service-Specific Restrictions

1. VPC Peering:

No transitive peering (e.g., A ↔ B ↔ C).

Cannot peer across different AWS organizations without proper setup.



2. Transit Gateway:

Attachment Limit: 5,000 VPC and VPN attachments.

Bandwidth: Maximum 50 Gbps per VPC attachment.



3. Interface Endpoints:

Each endpoint supports only specific services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).

A service might require multiple endpoints (e.g., for different AZs).





---

Monitoring and Logging

1. VPC Flow Logs:

Flow logs do not capture DNS traffic or traffic to/from AWS services using private IPs.

Additional charges apply based on the volume of logs.



2. CloudWatch Logs and Alarms:

Limits on the number of metrics and alarms that can be created.





---

IPv6 Considerations

1. Dual-Stack Mode:

Both IPv4 and IPv6 must be configured for dual-stack workloads.



2. Routing:

IPv6 routing needs to be explicitly added to route tables.





---

Other General Limitations

1. Limits on VPN Connections:

A single VGW supports up to 10 IPsec VPN connections.



2. Elastic IP (EIP) Addresses:

Limit: 5 per region by default (can request an increase).



3. Instance Networking:

Instances are limited by the bandwidth of the network interface and instance type.





---

These restrictions should be carefully considered during the design phase to ensure the architecture aligns with AWS limits while remaining scalable and cost-efficient.

Subnet: "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:subnet/subnet-id"

Security Group: "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:security-group/sg-id"


Example:

"Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/vpc-0abcd1234efgh5678"


---

By applying these IAM policies, you can grant granular permissions to users, groups, or roles while adhering to the principle of least privilege.
