Container Orchestration
Container orchestration involves the lifecycle management of container workloads, including functions such as to schedule, stop, start, and replicate across a cluster of machines. Compute resources for running workloads are abstracted, allowing the host infrastructure to be treated as a single logical deployment target. Kubernetes is an open source community project addressing container orchestration. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery, and features self-healing, service discovery, load balancing, and storage services among its rich feature set. Orchestration plays a critical role in our design goal of application-centricity as quality of service attributes and deployment patterns are executed by invoking Kubernetes API primitive
