# CLOSE_WAIT socket connection

Certainly! Let's dive into the details of **TIME_WAIT** and **CLOSE_WAIT** states in networking:

1. **TIME_WAIT**:
   - **Purpose**: TIME_WAIT indicates that the local endpoint (this side) has closed a connection.
   - **Function**: It keeps the connection around for a short period (usually four minutes) to handle any delayed packets that might arrive.
   - **Why?**: Packets can still be in transit even after the connection is closed, so TIME_WAIT ensures proper handling.
   - **Removal**: Connections in TIME_WAIT state will be removed automatically after the timeout.

2. **CLOSE_WAIT**:
   - **Purpose**: CLOSE_WAIT indicates that the remote endpoint (other side of the connection) has closed the connection.
   - **Function**: It waits for the local application to close the socket.
   - **Scenario**: The local process hasn't yet acknowledged the remote end's closure.
   - **Handling**: If the process doesn't close the socket, CLOSE_WAIT connections can accumulate.

Remember, these states help manage network connections effectively! üöÄüåü ¬π¬≤

CLOSE_WAIT means that the local end of the connection has received a FIN from the other end, but the OS is waiting for the program at the local end to actually close its connection.

The problem is your program running on the local machine is not closing the socket. It is not a TCP tuning issue. A connection can (and quite correctly) stay in CLOSE_WAIT forever while the program holds the connection open.

Once the local program closes the socket, the OS can send the FIN to the remote end which transitions you to LAST_ACK while you wait for the ACK of the FIN. Once that is received, the connection is finished and drops from the connection table (if your end is in CLOSE_WAIT you do not end up in the TIME_WAIT state).

You can forcibly close sockets with ss command. The ss command is a utility that allows you to dump socket statistics and displays information sockets, including network connections. It is similar to the netstat command, but is generally faster and more efficient.

To forcibly close sockets in the CLOSE_WAIT state using the ss command, you can use the --tcp option to specify that you want to view TCP sockets, and the state CLOSE-WAIT option to specify that you only want to view sockets that are in the CLOSE_WAIT state. For example:

`$ ss --tcp state CLOSE-WAIT`

This will display a list of all TCP sockets that are in the CLOSE_WAIT state.

To forcibly close these sockets, you can use the --kill option. This will send a signal to the socket, causing it to be closed. For example:

`$ ss --tcp state CLOSE-WAIT --kill`

You can also use the --tcp option to filter the sockets that you want to close based on various criteria. For example, you can use the dport option to specify a specific port number, or the dst option to specify a specific destination IP address. For example:

`$ ss --tcp state CLOSE-WAIT '( dport = 22 or dst 1.1.1.1 )' --kill`

This will forcibly close all TCP sockets in the CLOSE_WAIT state that are connected to port 22 or have a destination IP address of 1.1.1.1.

It is important to note that using the ss command to forcibly close sockets can have unintended consequences, as it may disrupt ongoing network connections. It is generally a good idea to use this command with caution, and only when it is necessary to do so.


TIME_WAIT indicates that local endpoint (this side) has closed the connection. TIME_WAIT represents waiting for enough time to be sure that remote TCP received the ACK of its FIN request. 



The **TIME_WAIT** state in TCP connections ensures that any delayed packets related to a closed connection are handled correctly. While the default value for this state is 60 seconds, you can adjust it by modifying the `tcp_fin_timeout` parameter in the Linux kernel. However, there are some considerations:

1. **`tcp_fin_timeout`**:
   - This parameter controls the time a socket remains in TIME_WAIT after the connection is closed.
   - To change it, you can echo a new value (in seconds) to `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout`.
   - For example:
     ```
     echo "10" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout
     ```
   - Restarting the network service may be necessary for the changes to take effect¬≥.

2. **Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL)**:
   - The TIME_WAIT time is generally set to double the MSL.
   - MSL represents the maximum age your packets are allowed to reach before the network discards them.
   - The actual MSL depends on network properties (e.g., satellite vs. LAN lifetimes).

3. **Reuse Ports**:
   - Some operating systems allow reusing ports by configuring kernel parameters.
   - However, in Linux, the TIME_WAIT counter is hard-coded to 60 seconds‚Åµ.

Remember, adjusting TIME_WAIT should be done carefully to avoid issues like constant recreation of proxy tunnels or unexpected behavior! üöÄüåü ¬π¬≤
