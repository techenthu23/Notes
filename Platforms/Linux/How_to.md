# To find out info related to ELF Shared Object file


The Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is a standard file format used for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps in Unix-like operating systems⁶. Here's a detailed look at its structure and components:

### Structure of an ELF File

1. **ELF Header**:
   - Located at the beginning of the file.
   - Contains metadata such as the file type (executable, shared object, etc.), architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), endianness, and entry point address.

2. **Program Header Table**:
   - Describes the segments used at runtime.
   - Contains information needed to load the file into memory, such as segment sizes and memory addresses.

3. **Section Header Table**:
   - Describes the sections within the file.
   - Contains details used during linking, such as section names, sizes, and offsets.

4. **Data**:
   - Includes the actual code, data, and other information referenced by the headers.

### Key Components

- **Segments**: Used during execution to map the file into memory.
- **Sections**: Used during linking to organize the file's contents.

### Tools for Analyzing ELF Files

- **`readelf`**: Displays information about ELF files.
  ```bash
  readelf -a libgem.so
  ```
- **`objdump`**: Provides detailed information about the file.
  ```bash
  objdump -x libgem.so
  ```
- **`nm`**: Lists symbols from object files.
  ```bash
  nm libgem.so
  ```

### Example of Using `readelf`

To view the ELF header:
```bash
readelf -h libgem.so
```

This command will display the ELF header, including the file's class (32-bit or 64-bit), data encoding (little-endian or big-endian), and entry point address.

Understanding the ELF format is crucial for tasks such as debugging, reverse engineering, and performance optimization²⁷.


To determine the version of the `lib*.so` file, you can use several methods. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Using `strings` and `grep`**:
   ```bash
   strings libgem.so | grep -i version
   ```

2. **Using `readelf`**:
   ```bash
   readelf -d libgem.so | grep SONAME
   ```

3. **Using `objdump`**:
   ```bash
   objdump -p libgem.so | grep SONAME
   ```

4. **Using `nm`**:
   ```bash
   nm -D libgem.so | grep -i version
   ```

These commands will help you extract version information embedded within the shared library file. If the version information is not directly available, you might need to refer to the documentation or metadata associated with the library.

Is there a specific issue you're encountering with `libgem.so` that you're trying to resolve?
