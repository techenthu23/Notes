# System Requirements

Kali Linux is supported on amd64 (x86_64/64-bit) and i386 (x86/32-bit) platforms. Where possible, we would recommend using the amd64 images.


The installation requirements for Kali Linux will vary depending on what you would like to install and your setup. For system requirements:

    - On the low end, you can set up Kali Linux as a basic Secure Shell (SSH) server with no desktop, using as little as 128 MB of RAM (512 MB recommended) and 2 GB of disk space.
    - On the higher end, if you opt to install the default Xfce4 desktop and the kali-linux-default metapackage, you should really aim for at least 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of disk space.

    When using resource-intensive applications, such as Burp Suite, they recommend at least 8 GB of RAM (and even more if it is a large web application!) or using simultaneous programs at the same time.
