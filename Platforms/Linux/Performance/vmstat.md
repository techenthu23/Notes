# vmstat

The `vmstat` ( Virtual Memory Statustucs) command is a powerful tool for monitoring system performance in Linux. It provides information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity. Here's how to read the performance metrics from the `vmstat` command and understand which parameters indicate issues with specific components:

### **Basic `vmstat` Command Output**

When you run `vmstat`, the output is divided into several sections:

```bash
vmstat [options] [delay [count]]
```

### **Sections and Key Parameters**

1. **Procs (Processes)**
   - **r**: Number of runnable processes (processes waiting for CPU time).
   - **b**: Number of processes in uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O).

   **Indicators**:
   - High `r` value: CPU bottleneck, too many processes waiting for CPU.
   - High `b` value: I/O bottleneck, processes waiting for I/O operations.

2. **Memory**
   - **swpd**: Amount of virtual memory used.
   - **free**: Amount of idle memory.
   - **buff**: Amount of memory used as buffers.
   - **cache**: Amount of memory used as cache.

   **Indicators**:
   - Low `free` value: Potential memory shortage.
   - High `swpd` value: Excessive swapping, indicating memory pressure.

3. **Swap**
   - **si**: Amount of memory swapped in from disk (per second).
   - **so**: Amount of memory swapped out to disk (per second).

   **Indicators**:
   - High `si` or `so` values: Excessive swapping, indicating insufficient physical memory.

4. **IO (Input/Output)**
   - **bi**: Blocks received from a block device (per second).
   - **bo**: Blocks sent to a block device (per second).

   **Indicators**:
   - High `bi` or `bo` values: High I/O activity, potential I/O bottleneck.

5. **System**
   - **in**: Number of interrupts per second.
   - **cs**: Number of context switches per second.

   **Indicators**:
   - High `in` value: High interrupt rate, possibly due to hardware issues.
   - High `cs` value: High context switching, indicating CPU contention.

6. **CPU**
   - **us**: Time spent running non-kernel code (user time).
   - **sy**: Time spent running kernel code (system time).
   - **id**: Time spent idle.
   - **wa**: Time spent waiting for I/O.
   - **st**: Time stolen from a virtual machine.

   **Indicators**:
   - High `us` value: High user-space CPU usage.
   - High `sy` value: High kernel-space CPU usage.
   - Low `id` value: CPU is busy.
   - High `wa` value: CPU waiting for I/O operations.
   - High `st` value: CPU resources being used by other virtual machines.

### **Example Usage**

To monitor system performance in real-time, you can use a delay and count:

```bash
vmstat 1 5
```

This command will display the system performance every second for five iterations.

### **Interpreting the Output**

- **CPU Bottleneck**: High `r` value, low `id` value.
- **Memory Pressure**: Low `free` value, high `si` and `so` values.
- **I/O Bottleneck**: High `b` value, high `wa` value, high `bi` and `bo` values.
- **High Interrupts**: High `in` value.
- **High Context Switching**: High `cs` value.

By understanding these parameters, you can diagnose performance issues and identify which components (CPU, memory, I/O) are causing bottlenecks⁴⁵[^10^].

# How can I troubleshoot high context switching?

A context switch is described as the kernel suspending execution of one process on the CPU and resuming execution of some other process that had previously been suspended. A context switch is required for every interrupt and every task that the scheduler picks.

Context switching can be due to multitasking, Interrupt handling , user & kernel mode switching. The interrupt rate will naturally go high, if there is higher network traffic, or higher disk traffic. Also it is dependent on the application which every now and then invoking system calls.

If the cores/CPU's are not sufficient to handle load of threads created by application will also result in context switching.

It is not a cause of concern until performance breaks down. This is expected that CPU will do context switching. One shouldn't verify these data at first place since there are many statistical data which should be analyzed prior to looking into kernel activities. Verify the CPU, memory and network usage during this time. Sar utility will provide these data.

High context switching can indicate performance issues, often due to CPU contention or inefficient application behavior. Here are steps to troubleshoot and address high context switching:

### **1. Identify the Cause**

- **Use `vmstat`**: Monitor context switching with `vmstat`:

  ```bash
  vmstat 1 5
  ```

  Look at the `cs` column for context switch rates.

- **Use `pidstat`**: Identify processes with high context switching:

  ```bash
  pidstat -w 1 5
  ```

  This command shows context switches per process. Then with help of PID which is causing issue, one can get all system calls details:

    ```bash
    strace -c -f -p <pid of process/thread>
    ```

    Let this command run for a few minutes while the load/context switch rates are high. It is safe to run this on a production system so you could run it on a good system as well to provide a comparative baseline. Through strace, one can debug & troubleshoot the issue, by looking at system calls the process has made.

### **2. Analyze System Load**

- **Check CPU Usage**: High context switching often correlates with high CPU usage. Use `top` or `htop` to monitor CPU load and identify processes consuming the most CPU.

  ```bash
  top
  ```

- **Check Interrupts**: High interrupt rates can cause context switching. Use `vmstat` or `iostat` to monitor interrupts.

  ```bash
  vmstat -i
  ```

### **3. Optimize Applications**

- **Review Application Code**: Inefficient code can cause excessive context switching. Optimize code to reduce unnecessary system calls and context switches.
- **Adjust Threading**: Ensure applications are not creating too many threads. Use thread pools and manage thread lifecycles efficiently.

### **4. System Configuration**

- **Increase CPU Resources**: If the system is under heavy load, consider adding more CPU cores or distributing the load across multiple servers.
- **Tune Kernel Parameters**: Adjust kernel parameters related to process scheduling and context switching. For example, you can modify the `sched_latency_ns` parameter to change the scheduler's behavior.

### **5. Monitor and Validate**

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools like `sar`, `collectl`, or `perf` to continuously monitor context switching and system performance.

  ```bash
  sar -w 1 5
  ```

- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare current context switch rates with baseline values to identify anomalies.

### **Example Commands**

Here are some example commands to help you get started:

- **Monitor Context Switching**:

  ```bash
  vmstat 1 5
  pidstat -w 1 5
  ```

- **Check CPU and Interrupts**:

  ```bash
  top
  vmstat -i
  ```

- **Continuous Monitoring**:

  ```bash
  sar -w 1 5
  ```

# How do I optimize code to reduce context switching?

Optimizing code to reduce context switching involves several strategies aimed at minimizing the overhead caused by frequent task switching. Here are some effective approaches:

### **1. Use Efficient Threading Models**

- **Lightweight Threads**: Use user-level threads or lightweight threads, which are managed by user-level code rather than the kernel. This reduces the overhead associated with context switching between kernel-level threads⁴.
- **Thread Pools**: Implement thread pools to manage a fixed number of threads, reducing the need to create and destroy threads frequently.

### **2. Minimize Lock Contention**

- **Fine-Grained Locking**: Use fine-grained locking instead of coarse-grained locking to reduce the time threads spend waiting for locks.
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Where possible, use lock-free data structures to avoid the overhead of locking altogether.

### **3. Optimize I/O Operations**

- **Asynchronous I/O**: Use asynchronous I/O operations to prevent threads from blocking while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple I/O operations together to reduce the frequency of context switches.

### **4. Reduce Interruptions**

- **Avoid Frequent System Calls**: Minimize the number of system calls, as each call can cause a context switch.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Use efficient algorithms and data structures to reduce the computational overhead and the need for frequent context switches.

### **5. Profile and Monitor**

- **Performance Profiling**: Use profiling tools to identify hotspots in your code where context switching is frequent. Tools like `perf`, `gprof`, or `valgrind` can help.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Continuously monitor your application to detect and address performance issues related to context switching.

### **6. Optimize Task Scheduling**

- **Task Affinity**: Set CPU affinity for threads to keep them on the same CPU, reducing the overhead of migrating threads between CPUs.
- **Batching Tasks**: Group similar tasks together to minimize the need for context switching.

### **7. Code Refactoring**

- **Modular Code**: Write modular code to isolate different functionalities, reducing the need for frequent context switches.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Ensure efficient management of resources like memory and file handles to avoid unnecessary context switches.

### **Example Techniques**

- **Using Thread Pools in Python**:

  ```python
  from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

  def task():
      # Your task implementation
      pass

  with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
      for _ in range(100):
          executor.submit(task)
  ```

- **Asynchronous I/O in Node.js**:

  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');

  fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(data);
  });
  ```

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the overhead caused by context switching, leading to more efficient and performant code¹²³.

# What if my system has high interrupt rates but low CPU usage?

### **3. Disable Unused Hardware**

- **Disable Unused Devices**: Disable any unused hardware devices in the BIOS or operating system to reduce unnecessary interrupts.

  ```bash
  sudo lshw -short  # List hardware components
  ```

### **4. Optimize System Settings**

- **Adjust Power Settings**: Ensure that your system's power settings are optimized for performance rather than power saving, as power-saving modes can sometimes cause high interrupt rates.

  ```bash
  sudo powertop  # Tool to diagnose power consumption issues
  ```

### **5. Monitor and Analyze**

- **Use `perf`**: Utilize the `perf` tool to analyze interrupt sources and identify the root cause.

  ```bash
  sudo perf top  # Real-time performance monitoring
  ```

- **Use `irqbalance`**: Install and configure `irqbalance` to distribute hardware interrupts across multiple CPUs, which can help reduce the load on a single CPU.

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install irqbalance
  sudo systemctl enable irqbalance
  sudo systemctl start irqbalance
  ```

### **6. Check for System Logs**

- **Review System Logs**: Check system logs for any hardware-related errors or warnings that might indicate the source of the interrupts.

  ```bash
  sudo dmesg | grep -i irq  # Check for IRQ-related messages
  sudo journalctl -k | grep -i irq  # Check kernel logs for IRQ issues
  ```

### **Example Commands**

Here are some example commands to help you get started:

- **Check BIOS Version**:

  ```bash
  sudo dmidecode -s bios-version
  ```

- **List Hardware Components**:

# Tell me more about analyzing `perf` output for interrupts

Analyzing `perf` output for interrupts can help you identify the sources of high interrupt rates and understand their impact on system performance. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use `perf` for this purpose:

### **1. Recording Performance Data**

To start, you need to record performance data using `perf record`. You can include the `--call-graph` option to capture call graphs, which will help you trace the source of interrupts.

```bash
sudo perf record -e irq:irq_handler_entry --call-graph dwarf -a sleep 10
```

This command records interrupt handler entries for 10 seconds, capturing call graphs using DWARF.

### **2. Analyzing the Recorded Data**

Once you have recorded the data, you can analyze it using `perf report`.

```bash
sudo perf report
```

This command will display a report of the recorded performance data. Look for entries related to interrupts, which will be listed under the `irq:irq_handler_entry` event.

### **3. Interpreting the Report**

The `perf report` output will show you the functions and call stacks associated with interrupts. Here’s what to look for:

- **Overhead**: The percentage of CPU time spent handling interrupts.
- **Call Graph**: The call stack leading to the interrupt handler. This helps identify which functions are triggering interrupts.

### **4. Example Analysis**

Here’s an example of what the `perf report` output might look like:

```
# Overhead  Command  Shared Object       Symbol
# ........  .......  ..................  ..................................
#
    10.00%  swapper  [kernel.kallsyms]   [k] irq_handler_entry
             |
             --- irq_handler_entry
                |
                |-- 5.00% [kernel.kallsyms] [k] handle_irq_event_percpu
                |-- 3.00% [kernel.kallsyms] [k] handle_irq_event
                |-- 2.00% [kernel.kallsyms] [k] generic_handle_irq
```

In this example:

- **irq_handler_entry**: The entry point for interrupt handling.
- **handle_irq_event_percpu**: A function handling per-CPU interrupts.
- **handle_irq_event**: A function handling the interrupt event.
- **generic_handle_irq**: A generic interrupt handler.

### **5. Additional Tools and Options**

- **`perf top`**: For real-time monitoring of interrupts.

  ```bash
  sudo perf top -e irq:irq_handler_entry
  ```

- **`perf script`**: For detailed analysis and scripting.

  ```bash
  sudo perf script
  ```
