The Waterfall Model is a sequential development approach, in which development flows downwards through the phases of requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and maintenance.

In waterfall model, project is divided into sequential phases; emphasis is on

- planning,
- time schedules,
- target dates,
- budgets and
- implementation of an entire system at one time.

Tight control is maintained over the life of the project via extensive written documentation, formal reviews, and approval/signoff by the user and information technology management occurring at the end of most phases before beginning the next phase.

The waterfall methodology normally doesnâ€™t allow complete moving on the next stage unless the previous stage is fully completed and verified however there are few advantages and pitfalls in this methodology.

The Waterfall model is a traditional engineering approach applied to software engineering. It has been widely blamed for several
large-scale government projects running over budget, over time and sometimes failing to deliver on requirements due to the Big Design Up Front approach.
