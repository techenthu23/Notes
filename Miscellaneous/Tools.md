### Example: Detecting a Brute Force Attack

#### Scenario

A company uses a centralized log aggregation and correlation tool to monitor its network and system logs. The tool collects logs from various sources, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), web servers, and authentication systems.

#### Detection Process

1. **Log Aggregation**:
   - The tool aggregates logs from different sources into a centralized platform. This includes logs from the company's web server, firewall, and authentication system.

2. **Normalization**:
   - The logs are normalized into a standard format to make it easier to analyze and correlate data from different sources.

3. **Correlation Rules**:
   - The tool uses predefined correlation rules to identify suspicious patterns. One such rule is to detect multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login from the same IP address within a short time frame.

4. **Event Correlation**:
   - The tool detects a pattern where an IP address attempts to log in to the web server multiple times with incorrect credentials. After several failed attempts, a successful login is recorded from the same IP address.

5. **Alert Generation**:
   - The correlation rule triggers an alert, indicating a potential brute force attack. The alert includes details such as the source IP address, the number of failed attempts, and the time of the successful login.

6. **Incident Response**:
   - The security team receives the alert and investigates further. They identify the source IP address and block it at the firewall to prevent further attempts. They also check the compromised account for any unauthorized activities and reset the credentials.

#### Benefits of Log Aggregation and Correlation

- **Improved Detection**: By correlating logs from multiple sources, the tool can detect complex attack patterns that might be missed if logs were analyzed in isolation.
- **Faster Response**: Real-time alerts enable the security team to respond quickly to potential threats, minimizing the impact of the attack.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Aggregated logs provide a complete picture of the incident, helping the security team understand the attack vector and take appropriate measures to prevent future incidents.

This example illustrates how log aggregation and correlation can enhance an organization's ability to detect and respond to security incidents effectively¹².
