# Health>

Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) all involve an adverse reaction to gluten and are treated with a gluten-free diet. These conditions are considered forms of gluten intolerance (2Trusted Source).,

While both celiac disease and NCGS may lead to intestinal damage and cause symptoms like diarrhea, gas, and bloating, celiac is an autoimmune condition linked to other serious health effects, such as anemia, stunted growth, and neurological effects

For people with celiac disease, research suggests that the usual threshold for gluten consumption 10 milligrams (mg) per day.

Having a diet with a gluten content of 20 parts per million (ppm) should put most people below the 10 mg threshold.

# Foods to avoid

1) Grains that contain gluten include:

Grains that contain gluten include:

- wheat:  Gehun, Gahu
- Broken wheat, Cracked wheat : Dalia, Lapsi
- Cream of wheat, semolina : Sooji, suji Rava
- barley
- rye
- triticale:- a fertile hybrid cereal, a cross between wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale)
- farina :- fine meal made from cereal grain especially wheat; often used as a cooked cereal or in puddings, Maida
- spelt:- In Marathi, spelt is referred to as “dhana” or “jav.”
- kamut: also called Khorasan wheat or Pharaoh grain
- wheat berries: Wheat berries are the edible part of the wheat kernel, including the wheat bran, the germ, and the endosperm, before the grain undergoes any processing. The bran is the hard outer layer of the wheat kernel.
- farro: Farro, a high-protein, high-fiber ancient whole-grain wheat, looks similar to barley, though with a slightly more oblong and larger grain.
- couscous

> Note that oats are naturally gluten-free but may be contaminated with gluten during processing.

If your physician suspects celiac disease, he will run blood tests to look for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, or tTGA, and anti-endomysium antibodies, or EMA, which are often present with celiac disease, according to the NIDDK. If the tests are negative, but your physician still suspects celiac disease, he will take a small sample of your intestine to examine it for damage to the villi.

There are eight B vitamins, though they often go by names such as niacin, thiamine, pyroxidine and riboflavin. All B vitamins work within the body to convert carbohydrates to energy. The body does not create B vitamins, so people must consume them in foods such as fortified cereals, poultry, shellfish and eggs. While all B vitamins play a role in energy conversion, B12 has the most impact on energy levels.

B vitamins are not only necessary for converting carbohydrates within food to energy; the body also needs B vitamins for DNA synthesis, tissue and cellular repair, cell production and even the production of sex- and stress-related hormones, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center 3.

Fatty Liver:
Reduce saturated fat intake such as red meat, processed meats, butter and ice cream , etc and rather eat more of the good fats that is, poly or monounsaturated fats that come from fish, nuts and avocados, olive oil
Avoid sugary drinks

A glass of warm water with lemon juice is supposed to cleanse the liver
Nitrates are abundant in beetroot juice, which also functions as an antioxidant and may benefit heart health and inflammation reduction. Beets may be useful in the battle against fatty liver disease.
To assist your liver get rid of toxins by including fruits like apples that are high in fibre in your diet. Moreover, it supports digestive systems in a healthy way.
In liver problems, olive oil and its extract are helpful. According to several studies, it possesses a potent antioxidant that shields the liver from various toxins.
Walnuts: The amino acid arginine, which helps liver cleansing, is abundant in walnuts. In instance, walnuts have a lot of plant-based chemicals. Blood in the liver is oxygenated better when we consume walnuts.
Fatty fish: Omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in fatty fish, aid to lessen liver inflammation. These fats keep enzyme levels in check and stop additional fat from building up in the liver.
Avocado : This green superfood contains different vitamins and minerals that enhance the liver's general health. It has a special antioxidant called glutathione that aids in your body's detoxification process.
Green Tea : Green tea contains a lot of catechins, which are antioxidants. Catechin aids in liver cleansing and lessens liver inflammation.

# Nutrient Deficiencies and Celiac Disease: Understanding the Connection

Celiac.com 04/15/2023 -

Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. One often overlooked consequence of untreated and undiagnosed celiac disease is the potential for nutrient deficiencies. Due to the damage caused to the lining of the small intestine, absorption of various essential nutrients may be impaired, leading to deficiencies that can have wide-ranging health effects. In this article, we will explore the connection between celiac disease and nutrient deficiencies, focusing on several key vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients.

The most common nutrient deficiencies associated with celiac disease that may lead to testing for the condition include iron, vitamin D, folate (vitamin B9), vitamin B12, calcium, zinc, and magnesium. Celiac disease can disrupt the absorption of these essential nutrients, potentially leading to anemia, bone health issues, and other health complications. After a celiac disease diagnosis it is important to do follow up testing for these nutrient deficiencies, as well as a follow-up endoscopies/biopsies to make sure that a patient's damaged villi are healing properly. Many of those with celiac disease will need to take vitamin and mineral supplements at the time of their diagnosis, and some will need to continue taking them for life. Note that having nutrient deficiencies alone would not be enough for a definitive diagnosis of celiac disease, and further testing is required to make a formal diagnosis.

- Boron
Boron is a trace mineral that plays a role in bone health, brain function, and metabolism of certain nutrients. Deficiency in boron is rare, but it can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, joint pain, and impaired cognitive function. Untreated and undiagnosed celiac disease can cause malabsorption of boron due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. Supplementation of boron may be needed for individuals with celiac disease, especially if they have prolonged untreated celiac disease or other risk factors for deficiency.

- Calcium
Calcium is an essential mineral that is crucial for bone health, nerve function, and muscle contraction. Deficiency in calcium can lead to symptoms such as weakened bones, muscle cramps, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Malabsorption of calcium can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can further increase the risk of osteoporosis and other bone-related complications in individuals with celiac disease. Measuring blood levels of calcium alone is not always an accurate indicator of calcium deficiency because the body will leach calcium from the bones to maintain normal blood levels of calcium. Therefore, bone density loss and other secondary indicators are often better diagnostic tools for detecting calcium deficiency. Calcium supplementation, along with a calcium-rich diet, may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease to maintain adequate calcium levels and support bone health.

- Chloride
Chloride is an electrolyte that is involved in maintaining proper fluid balance, nerve function, and acid-base balance in the body. Deficiency in chloride is rare, but it can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, lethargy, and irregular heartbeat. Malabsorption of chloride can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can disrupt the body's fluid balance and electrolyte levels, further complicating the health of individuals with celiac disease. Proper monitoring of chloride levels and supplementation may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease, especially if they have prolonged untreated celiac disease or other risk factors for deficiency.

- Choline

    Choline is an essential nutrient that plays a role in brain development, nerve function, and liver health. Deficiency in choline can lead to symptoms such as cognitive decline, liver dysfunction, and muscle damage. In celiac disease, malabsorption of choline can occur due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. Supplementation of choline may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease, especially if they have prolonged untreated celiac disease or other risk factors for deficiency.

- Chromium

    Chromium is a trace mineral that is important for glucose metabolism and insulin function. Deficiency in chromium can lead to symptoms such as impaired glucose tolerance, increased insulin resistance, and poor blood sugar control. Malabsorption of chromium can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. Supplementation of chromium may be needed for individuals with celiac disease, especially if they have poor blood sugar control or other risk factors for deficiency.

- Copper
    
    Copper is an essential trace mineral that plays a role in various processes in the body, including energy production, connective tissue formation, and immune function. Deficiency in copper can cause symptoms such as anemia, bone abnormalities, and impaired immune function. In celiac disease, malabsorption of copper can occur due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can further compromise the overall health of individuals with celiac disease and increase the risk of related complications. Supplementation of copper may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease to maintain adequate copper levels and support overall health.

- Iodine

    Iodine is a trace mineral that is essential for thyroid function, metabolism, and brain development. Deficiency in iodine can cause symptoms such as goiter, fatigue, weight gain, and impaired cognitive function. Malabsorption of iodine can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can further disrupt thyroid function and metabolism, and impair cognitive development in individuals with celiac disease, especially in children. Iodine supplementation, along with a well-balanced diet that includes iodine-rich foods such as seafood and iodized salt, may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease to maintain adequate iodine levels and support overall health.

- Iron

    Iron is an essential mineral that is required for the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. Deficiency in iron can cause symptoms such as anemia, fatigue, weakness, and pale skin. Malabsorption of iron can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can further exacerbate the risk of anemia and related health issues in individuals with celiac disease. Iron supplementation, along with a well-balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods such as meat, poultry, beans, and fortified cereals, may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease to maintain adequate iron levels and support overall health.

- Lutein

    Lutein is a carotenoid antioxidant that is important for eye health and vision. Deficiency in lutein can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, macular degeneration, and increased risk of eye-related disorders. Malabsorption of lutein can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can further increase the risk of eye-related issues and compromised vision in individuals with celiac disease. Lutein supplementation, along with a diet rich in lutein-containing foods such as leafy green vegetables, egg yolks, and corn, may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease to maintain adequate lutein levels and support overall eye health.

- Lycopene

    Lycopene is a carotenoid antioxidant that is known for its role in prostate health and reducing the risk of certain cancers. Deficiency in lycopene can cause symptoms such as increased risk of prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, and oxidative stress. Malabsorption of lycopene can occur in celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine lining, potentially leading to a deficiency. This can further increase the risk of prostate cancer, cardiovascular issues, and other health complications in individuals with celiac disease. Lycopene supplementation, along with a diet rich in lycopene-containing foods such as tomatoes, watermelon, and red bell peppers, may be necessary for individuals with celiac disease to maintain adequate lycopene levels and support overall health.

- Magnesium

    Magnesium is a vital mineral that plays a critical role in numerous physiological processes, including nerve function, muscle contraction, and bone health. Deficiency in magnesium can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, tremors, irregular heartbeat, and bone loss.
