# Verifing the validity of an SSL certificate in Python

To verify the validity of an SSL certificate in Python, you have a few options. Remember to adjust the code according to your specific use case and requirements.

Let's explore them:

1. **Using the `ssl` module (Python 2.6 and later):**

   You can write your own certificate validator using the `ssl` module. While it's not optimal, it's doable. Here's an example snippet:

   ```python
   import ssl

   # Create an SSL context
   context = ssl.create_default_context()

   # Set certificate requirements (e.g., required, optional, none)
   context.check_hostname = True
   context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

   # Connect to the server
   hostname = "example.com"
   with socket.create_connection((hostname, 443)) as sock:
       with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname) as sslsock:
           # Check if the certificate is valid
           try:
               ssl.match_hostname(sslsock.getpeercert(), hostname)
               print("Certificate is valid.")
           except ssl.CertificateError as ce:
               print(f"Certificate validation failed: {ce}")
   ```

   Replace `"example.com"` with the actual domain you want to check.

2. **Using the `requests` library:**

   If you want a simpler approach, you can use the `requests` library to check the validity of an SSL certificate. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import requests

   def verify_ssl_certificate(url):
       try:
           response = requests.get(url)
           response.raise_for_status()
           print("Certificate is valid.")
       except requests.RequestException as e:
           print(f"Certificate validation failed: {e}")

   verify_ssl_certificate("https://www.example.com")
   ```

   Replace `"https://www.example.com"` with the actual URL you want to check.

# To verify if an SSL certificate is not self-signed and has not expired

To verify if an SSL certificate is not self-signed and has not expired, you can use the `requests` library in Python.

Here's an example script:

```python
import requests

def check_ssl_certificate(host, port):
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"https://{host}:{port}")
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an exception if the status code is not 2xx
        print(f"Certificate for {host}:{port} is valid.")
    except requests.exceptions.SSLError:
        print(f"Certificate for {host}:{port} is self-signed or invalid.")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to {host}:{port}: {e}")

# Example usage
check_ssl_certificate("example.com", 443)
```

Replace `"example.com"` and `443` with your desired host and port. This script will check if the certificate is self-signed or invalid. If it's valid, it won't raise an exception, indicating that the certificate is not self-signed and has not expired¹³. If you need more advanced certificate validation, consider using the `ssl` module or other libraries like `backports.ssl_match_hostname`¹. Remember to handle exceptions appropriately based on your use case.


# To verify if an address is using a self-signed SSL certificate in Python, you can use the `requests` library. 

Here are a couple of approaches:

1. **Using the `verify` parameter:**
   You can pass the path to a public key file (in PEM format) to the `verify` parameter. This way, `requests` will trust the certificate from that file. For example:

   ```python
   import requests
   url = 'https://example.com'
   r = requests.get(url, verify='/path/to/public_key.pem')
   ```

   Note that the `.pem` file should include the server's certificate and any intermediate certificates¹.

2. **Bypassing the check altogether:**
   If you want to bypass the certificate check entirely (e.g., for load tests), you can use `verify=False` along with disabling insecure request warnings:

   ```python
   import requests
   import urllib3
   urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)
   url = 'https://example.com'
   r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
   ```

Remember to replace `'https://example.com'` with the actual address you want to verify.

# To extract the expiration date from an SSL certificate in Python, you have a few options

Let's explore them:

1. **Using `ssl` and `cryptography` libraries**:
   You can use the `ssl` library along with the `cryptography` library to extract the expiration date. Here's an example:

    ```python
    import ssl
    from cryptography import x509

    def get_ssl_expiry_date(host, port):
        context = ssl.create_default_context()
        with ssl.create_connection((host, port)) as sock:
            with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=host) as ssock:
                data = ssock.getpeercert()
                notafter_date = data["notAfter"]
                print(f"Expiry date: {notafter_date}")

    # Example usage
    get_ssl_expiry_date("example.com", 443)
    ```

   Replace `"example.com"` and `443` with your desired host and port. This script will print the expiration date of the SSL certificate¹.

2. **Using `pyOpenSSL`**:
   You can also use the `pyOpenSSL` library to achieve the same result:

    ```python
    import ssl
    import OpenSSL
    import datetime

    def get_ssl_expiry_date(host, port):
        cert = ssl.get_server_certificate((host, port))
        x509 = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert)
        expiration_date = x509.get_notAfter().decode("utf-8")
        print(f"Expiry date: {expiration_date}")

    # Example usage
    get_ssl_expiry_date("example.com", 443)
    ```

   This script fetches the SSL certificate and extracts the expiration date using `pyOpenSSL`².

3. **Using `aiohttp` (for asynchronous requests)**:
   If you're working with asynchronous code, you can use `aiohttp` to fetch the SSL certificate expiration date:

    ```python
    import aiohttp
    import datetime

    async def fetch_ssl_certificate_expiration(url):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.head(url) as response:
                ssl_info = response.ssl
                if ssl_info:
                    cert = ssl_info.get("certificate", None)
                    if cert:
                        expiration_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(cert["notAfter"], "%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z")
                        return expiration_date
                return None

    # Example usage
    url = "https://example.com"
    expiration_date = asyncio.run(fetch_ssl_certificate_expiration(url))
    if expiration_date:
        print(f"SSL Certificate for {url} expires on: {expiration_date}")
    else:
        print(f"Unable to retrieve SSL certificate information for {url}")
    ```

   Adjust the `url` as needed for your use case³.

# To validate an SSL certificate against a CA bundle in Python

you have a couple of options:

1. **Using the `requests` library with Certifi**:

   The `requests` library allows you to verify SSL certificates against a CA bundle. By default, it uses the CA bundle provided by the `certifi` package. Here's an example:

    ```python
    import requests
    import certifi

    url = "https://example.com"
    response = requests.get(url, verify=certifi.where())

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Certificate for {url} is valid.")
    else:
        print(f"Certificate for {url} is invalid or expired.")
    ```

   Replace `"https://example.com"` with your desired URL. This code snippet will verify the SSL certificate using the CA bundle provided by `certifi`².

2. **Custom CA bundle path**:

   If you have your own CA bundle (e.g., an internal corporate CA), you can specify its path directly:

    ```python
    import requests

    url = "https://example.com"
    custom_ca_bundle_path = "/path/to/your/certificate.pem"
    response = requests.get(url, verify=custom_ca_bundle_path)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Certificate for {url} is valid.")
    else:
        print(f"Certificate for {url} is invalid or expired.")
    ```

   Adjust the `custom_ca_bundle_path` to point to your specific CA bundle file³.

Remember to handle exceptions appropriately based on your use case.

To validate SSL certificates for more than 10,000 hosts in Python, you have a few options:

1. **Using the `ssl` and `pyOpenSSL` libraries**:
   You can use the `ssl` module along with `pyOpenSSL` to fetch and verify SSL certificates. Here's an example:

    ```python
    import ssl
    import OpenSSL

    def get_ssl_expiry_date(host, port):
        cert = ssl.get_server_certificate((host, port))
        x509 = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert)
        expiration_date = x509.get_notAfter().decode("utf-8")
        print(f"Expiry date for {host}:{port}: {expiration_date}")

    # Example usage
    hosts = [("example.com", 443), ("another-site.com", 8443)]
    for host, port in hosts:
        get_ssl_expiry_date(host, port)
    ```

   Adjust the `hosts` list with your desired host-port pairs².

2. **Using a custom CA bundle**:
   If you have your own CA bundle (e.g., an internal corporate CA), specify its path directly:

    ```python
    import ssl
    import requests

    def check_ssl_certificate(host, port):
        try:
            response = requests.get(f"https://{host}:{port}", verify="/path/to/your/certificate.pem")
            response.raise_for_status()
            print(f"Certificate for {host}:{port} is valid.")
        except requests.exceptions.SSLError:
            print(f"Certificate for {host}:{port} is self-signed or invalid.")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error connecting to {host}:{port}: {e}")

    # Example usage
    hosts = [("example.com", 443), ("another-site.com", 8443)]
    for host, port in hosts:
        check_ssl_certificate(host, port)
    ```

   Adjust the paths and hosts as needed³.

Remember to handle exceptions appropriately based on your use case.

# To extract the expiration date from an SSL certificate in Python

you have a few options. Let's explore them:

1. **Using `ssl` and `pyOpenSSL` libraries**:

   You can use the `ssl` module along with the `pyOpenSSL` library to extract the expiration date. Here's an example:

    ```python
    import ssl
    import OpenSSL

    def get_ssl_expiry_date(host, port):
        cert = ssl.get_server_certificate((host, port))
        x509 = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert)
        expiration_date = x509.get_notAfter().decode("utf-8")
        print(f"Expiry date: {expiration_date}")

    # Example usage
    get_ssl_expiry_date("example.com", 443)
    ```

   Replace `"example.com"` and `443` with your desired host and port. This script will print the expiration date of the SSL certificate¹.

2. **Using `aiohttp` (for asynchronous requests)**:

   If you're working with asynchronous code, you can use `aiohttp` to fetch the SSL certificate expiration date:

    ```python
    import aiohttp
    import datetime

    async def fetch_ssl_certificate_expiration(url):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.head(url) as response:
                ssl_info = response.ssl
                if ssl_info:
                    cert = ssl_info.get("certificate", None)
                    if cert:
                        expiration_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(cert["notAfter"], "%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z")
                        return expiration_date
                return None

    # Example usage
    url = "https://example.com"
    expiration_date = asyncio.run(fetch_ssl_certificate_expiration(url))
    if expiration_date:
        print(f"SSL Certificate for {url} expires on: {expiration_date}")
    else:
        print(f"Unable to retrieve SSL certificate information for {url}")
    ```

   Adjust the `url` as needed for your use case³.

The `async` keyword in Python is used to define **asynchronous** functions and methods. Here's what it means and how it works:

1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Asynchronous programming allows you to write code that can perform multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution flow.
   - Traditionally, Python executes code sequentially (line by line), which can be inefficient when waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading files, making network requests, database queries).
   - Asynchronous code enables non-blocking execution, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for I/O-bound operations.

2. **`async` and `await`**:
   - The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function or method. It indicates that the function can pause its execution and yield control back to the event loop.
   - Inside an asynchronous function, you can use the `await` keyword to wait for other asynchronous functions or coroutines to complete.
   - When an `await` expression is encountered, the function suspends execution until the awaited task is done.

3. **Event Loop**:
   - Python's event loop manages asynchronous tasks. It schedules and runs coroutines (asynchronous functions) concurrently.
   - The event loop ensures that when one task is waiting (e.g., for I/O), other tasks can continue executing.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Asynchronous programming is beneficial for I/O-bound tasks (network requests, file I/O, database queries) and tasks that involve waiting.
   - Examples include web servers, APIs, scraping data from websites, and handling multiple client connections.

5. **Example**:

   ```python
   import asyncio

   async def fetch_data(url):
       # Simulate fetching data (e.g., making an HTTP request)
       await asyncio.sleep(1)
       return f"Data from {url}"

   async def main():
       urls = ["https://example.com", "https://another-site.com"]
       tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
       results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
       for result in results:
           print(result)

   asyncio.run(main())
   ```

   In this example, `fetch_data` is an asynchronous function that simulates fetching data. The `main` function awaits multiple tasks concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`.

6. **Remember**:
   - Asynchronous programming is powerful but requires understanding of event loops, coroutines, and proper handling of exceptions.
   - Use it when dealing with I/O-bound tasks or parallel execution, but not for CPU-bound tasks (where multiprocessing or threading may be more suitable).

In summary, `async` and `await` allow you to write efficient, non-blocking code that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. 🚀

# Coroutines are a fundamental concept in asynchronous programming. Let's dive into how they work:

1. **What is a Coroutine?**
   - A coroutine is a special type of function that can pause its execution and later resume from where it left off.
   - Unlike regular functions, coroutines yield control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.

2. **Syntax and Creation**:
   - To define a coroutine, use the `async def` syntax. For example:

     ```python
     async def my_coroutine():
         # Coroutine logic here
         await some_other_coroutine()
     ```

3. **`await` Keyword**:
   - Inside a coroutine, you can use the `await` keyword to wait for other asynchronous tasks (coroutines or futures) to complete.
   - When an `await` expression is encountered, the coroutine suspends execution until the awaited task finishes.

4. **Event Loop**:
   - Python's event loop (usually provided by libraries like `asyncio`) manages coroutines.
   - The event loop schedules and runs coroutines concurrently, switching between them as needed.

5. **Example**:

   ```python
   import asyncio

   async def greet(name):
       await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate I/O
       return f"Hello, {name}!"

   async def main():
       result1 = await greet("Alice")
       result2 = await greet("Bob")
       print(result1, result2)

   asyncio.run(main())
   ```

6. **Benefits**:
   - Coroutines improve efficiency for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, file I/O).
   - They allow non-blocking execution, making programs more responsive.

7. **Remember**:
   - Coroutines are not parallelism (they don't run on multiple CPU cores).
   - Use them for tasks that involve waiting (e.g., fetching data, handling connections).

In summary, coroutines enable asynchronous programming by allowing tasks to pause and resume, making Python more efficient for I/O-heavy workloads. 🚀

# Python's event loop is at the heart of asynchronous programming using libraries like `asyncio`. Let me explain how it manages tasks:

1. **Event Loop Basics**:
   - The event loop is the core of every asyncio application.
   - It runs asynchronous tasks, handles callbacks, performs network I/O operations, and manages subprocesses.
   - As an application developer, you'll mostly use high-level asyncio functions (like `asyncio.run()`), rarely needing to directly reference the loop object¹.

2. **Task Queue and Execution**:
   - Here's how it works:
     1. The main thread submits tasks (coroutines) to a task queue.
     2. The event loop constantly monitors the queue.
     3. It runs each task until it encounters I/O-bound operations (e.g., waiting for data from a network or file).
     4. When an I/O-bound operation occurs, the event loop switches to another task.
     5. Once the I/O operation completes, the original task resumes execution.

3. **Concurrency and Non-Blocking Execution**:
   - Tasks (coroutines) are scheduled to run on the event loop.
   - While a task awaits I/O, other tasks can continue executing concurrently.
   - This non-blocking behavior allows efficient handling of multiple tasks without blocking the entire program.

Remember, the event loop ensures efficient execution of asynchronous code, making Python responsive for I/O-heavy workloads! 🚀²³

# Managing network checks asynchronously using Python's `asyncio` library is a powerful way to handle multiple tasks concurrently. Below, I'll provide an example program that performs network checks asynchronously for a list of hosts. In this example, we'll simulate checking if the hosts are reachable (by pinging them). You can adapt this to your specific network checks.

```python
import asyncio
import subprocess

async def check_host(host):
    try:
        # Simulate a ping check (you can replace this with your actual network check)
        result = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(f"ping -c 1 {host}", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        await result.communicate()
        if result.returncode == 0:
            print(f"{host} is reachable.")
        else:
            print(f"{host} is not reachable.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking {host}: {e}")

async def main():
    hosts = ["example.com", "another-site.com", "localhost"]
    await asyncio.gather(*[check_host(host) for host in hosts])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here's what the program does:

1. Defines an `async` function `check_host` that simulates a ping check for a given host.
2. The `main` function gathers all the checks for multiple hosts concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`.
3. Replace the ping check with your actual network checks (e.g., HTTP requests, SSH connections, etc.).

Remember to adjust the network checks according to your requirements. 🚀⁹ [^10^] ¹¹

# Handling exceptions in asynchronous code, especially with `asyncio`, is crucial for robust and reliable programs

Let's explore some approaches:

1. **Handling Exceptions in Tasks Executed via `asyncio.gather()`**:
   - When using `asyncio.gather()`, you can set the `return_exceptions` argument to `True`. This traps any unhandled exceptions and provides them as return values, allowing other tasks to complete.
   - Example:

     ```python
     async def my_coroutine():
         # Your coroutine logic here
         raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

     tasks = [my_coroutine() for _ in range(5)]
     results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
     for result in results:
         if isinstance(result, Exception):
             print(f"Exception: {result}")
     ```

2. **Handling Exceptions Raised While Awaiting `asyncio.gather()`**:
   - If an exception occurs while awaiting `asyncio.gather()`, it propagates to the caller. You can handle it using a `try`/`except` block around the `await` statement.
   - Example:

     ```python
     try:
         await asyncio.gather(coro1(), coro2())
     except Exception as e:
         print(f"Exception during asyncio.gather(): {e}")
     ```

3. **Converting Raised Exceptions to Return Values**:
   - Sometimes you might want to convert exceptions into return values. You can catch exceptions within your coroutine and return a custom value instead.
   - Example:

     ```python
     async def my_coroutine():
         try:
             # Your logic here
             raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
         except ValueError as e:
             return f"Custom error message: {e}"

     result = await my_coroutine()
     print(result)
     ```

Remember to choose the approach that best fits your use case. Proper exception handling ensures your asynchronous code behaves predictably and gracefully! 🚀 ²³

# When using coroutines directly (not via `gather()`), you can handle exceptions in a few ways:

1. **Handle Exceptions Within Coroutines**:
   - Inside your coroutine, use `try`/`except` blocks to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.
   - Example:

     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def my_coroutine():
         try:
             # Your coroutine logic here
             raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
         except ValueError as e:
             print(f"Exception: {e}")

     asyncio.run(my_coroutine())
     ```

2. **Convert Raised Exceptions to Return Values**:
   - Instead of raising exceptions, you can return custom values when an error occurs.
   - Example:

     ```python
     async def my_coroutine():
         try:
             # Your logic here
             raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
         except ValueError as e:
             return f"Custom error message: {e}"

     result = await my_coroutine()
     print(result)
     ```

# Let's explore the difference between **coroutines** and **asyncio**:

1. **Coroutines**:
   - **Definition**: Coroutines are special functions that can pause their execution at specific points and later resume from where they left off.
   - **Syntax**: Declared using the `async def` syntax in Python.
   - **Purpose**: Coroutines allow for asynchronous programming by enabling non-blocking execution. They are awaitable objects.
   - **Example**:

     ```python
     async def greet():
         print("Hello")
         await asyncio.sleep(1)
         print("World")

     # Usage
     await greet()  # Awaits the coroutine
     ```

2. **Asyncio**:
   - **Definition**: Asyncio is a Python library for asynchronous programming. It provides tools and APIs to work with coroutines, tasks, and event loops.
   - **Purpose**: Asyncio allows you to write concurrent, non-blocking code for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, file I/O).
   - **Example**:

     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def main():
         await asyncio.sleep(1)
         print("Asyncio example")

     asyncio.run(main())  # Runs the top-level coroutine
     ```

3. **Relationship**:
   - Coroutines are a fundamental building block in asyncio. They enable asynchronous behavior, but asyncio provides additional features (like event loops, tasks, and utilities) to manage and execute coroutines efficiently.

In summary, coroutines are the core of asyncio, and asyncio provides the infrastructure to run them concurrently and handle asynchronous tasks. 🚀 ¹²

# **Asyncio** is a powerful Python library for asynchronous programming. Let's dive into the details:

1. **What Is Asyncio?**
   - Asyncio enables writing concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax.
   - It serves as the foundation for various Python asynchronous frameworks, providing high-performance solutions for network servers, web servers, database connections, and more.
   - Asyncio is particularly suitable for I/O-bound tasks and high-level structured network code⁵.

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Coroutines**: Coroutines (specialized generator functions) are at the heart of asyncio. They allow non-blocking execution and can pause and resume their execution.
   - **Event Loop**: The event loop manages coroutines, schedules their execution, and switches between tasks when waiting for I/O operations.
   - **async/await**: These keywords define coroutines and allow you to await other asynchronous tasks.
   - **Design Patterns**: Asyncio provides patterns for chaining coroutines, using queues, and more.

3. **Usage Scenarios**:
   - Asyncio is ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., fetching data from APIs, web scraping, handling network requests).
   - It's not suitable for CPU-bound tasks (where multiprocessing or threading may be better).

4. **Getting Started**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above.
   - Install the `aiohttp` and `aiofiles` packages.
   - Explore the asyncio package and its features¹.

In summary, asyncio empowers efficient, non-blocking Python code, making it a valuable tool for asynchronous programming! 🚀

# Managing **asynchronous event loops** in Python using `asyncio` is essential for efficient system performance. Let's explore how you can handle them:

1. **Event Loop Basics**:
   - The **event loop** is the core of every asyncio application.
   - It runs asynchronous tasks, handles callbacks, performs network I/O operations, and runs subprocesses.
   - As an application developer, you'll typically use high-level asyncio functions (like `asyncio.run()`), rarely needing to directly reference the loop object¹.

2. **Obtaining the Event Loop**:
   - You can get, set, or create an event loop using the following functions:
     - `asyncio.get_running_loop()`: Returns the running event loop in the current OS thread.
     - `asyncio.get_event_loop()`: Gets the current event loop (prefer using `get_running_loop()` in coroutines and callbacks).
     - `asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)`: Sets a loop as the current event loop.
     - `asyncio.new_event_loop()`: Creates and returns a new event loop object.

3. **Starting and Stopping the Loop**:
   - Start the event loop using `asyncio.run()` or `loop.run_until_complete()`.
   - Stop it using `loop.stop()`.
   - Properly close the event loop after use to release resources⁴.

4. **Multiple Event Loops**:
   - Different event loops can specialize in handling different types of tasks (I/O-bound or CPU-bound).
   - Assign event loops to different processor cores for better overall performance and responsiveness⁵.

Remember to use `asyncio.create_task()`, `await`, and `asyncio.gather()` when handling tasks within your event loop. This ensures smoother execution and efficient system performance! 🚀 ²³

# Let's explore a more complex example using **asyncio**. In this example, we'll create an asynchronous program that performs concurrent HTTP requests to multiple URLs using the `aiohttp` library. This demonstrates how asyncio can efficiently handle I/O-bound tasks.

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_url(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            content = await response.text()
            print(f"Received data from {url}: {len(content)} bytes")

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://www.example.com",
        "https://www.another-site.com",
        "https://www.yet-another-site.com",
    ]
    await asyncio.gather(*[fetch_url(url) for url in urls])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here's what the program does:

1. Defines an `async` function `fetch_url` that fetches data from a given URL using `aiohttp`.
2. The `main` function concurrently fetches data from multiple URLs using `asyncio.gather()`.
3. Adjust the `urls` list with your desired URLs.

Remember to install the `aiohttp` package (`pip install aiohttp`) before running this example. This demonstrates how asyncio efficiently manages multiple asynchronous tasks! 🚀 ¹²

# You can create a Python script to check the connectivity to a URL, verify the SSL certificate, and notify if it's expiring within a certain number of days. Here's an example script that accomplishes this:

```python
import socket
import ssl
import datetime

def ssl_expiry_datetime(hostname):
    ssl_dateformat = r'%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z'
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    context.check_hostname = False

    conn = context.wrap_socket(
        socket.socket(socket.AF_INET),
        server_hostname=hostname,
    )

    # Set a timeout for the connection (5 seconds in this example)
    conn.settimeout(5.0)
    conn.connect((hostname, 443))
    ssl_info = conn.getpeercert()

    # Return the expiration date as a Python datetime object
    return datetime.datetime.strptime(ssl_info['notAfter'], ssl_dateformat)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    domains_to_check = [
        "example.com",
        "google.com",
        # Add more domains here
    ]

    now = datetime.datetime.now()

    for domain in domains_to_check:
        try:
            expire = ssl_expiry_datetime(domain)
            days_remaining = (expire - now).days
            print(f"Domain: {domain} | Expiry Date: {expire.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} | Days Remaining: {days_remaining}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error checking {domain}: {e}")
```

Replace `"example.com"` and `"google.com"` with the actual domains you want to check. This script will print information about the SSL certificate expiration date and the number of days remaining. You can customize the notification logic based on your requirements. 😊¹²³⁴

    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Invalid JSON input. Please provide a valid URL in the 'url' field.")
```

Replace the example usage with your specific requirements. This script will prompt you to enter a URL in either Python or JSON format, extract the URL, and check its SSL certificate. Adjust the `days_threshold` as needed for your notification criteria.

# To verify if an address is using a self-signed SSL certificate in Python, you can use the `requests` library. 

Here are a couple of approaches:

1. **Using the `verify` parameter:**
   You can pass the path to a public key file (in PEM format) to the `verify` parameter. This way, `requests` will trust the certificate from that file. For example:

   ```python
   import requests
   url = 'https://example.com'
   r = requests.get(url, verify='/path/to/public_key.pem')
   ```

   Note that the `.pem` file should include the server's certificate and any intermediate certificates¹.

2. **Bypassing the check altogether:**
   If you want to bypass the certificate check entirely (e.g., for load tests), you can use `verify=False` along with disabling insecure request warnings:

   ```python
   import requests
   import urllib3
   urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)
   url = 'https://example.com'
   r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
   ```

Remember to replace `'https://example.com'` with the actual address you want to verify. 😊🔐²³⁴

# Python script that checks if an SSL certificate's serial number matches a given serial number and then verifies if the certificate is expiring within 10 days or has already expired.

This script uses the `ssl` and `cryptography` libraries.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the `cryptography` library installed:

   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

2. **Python Code**:

   ```python
   import ssl
   import socket
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from cryptography import x509
   from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

   def check_certificate(hostname, port, expected_serial_number):
       # Create a default SSL context
       context = ssl.create_default_context()

       # Connect to the server and get the certificate
       with socket.create_connection((hostname, port)) as sock:
           with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname) as ssock:
               cert_bin = ssock.getpeercert(binary_form=True)
               cert = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert_bin, default_backend())

       # Check the serial number
       serial_number = cert.serial_number
       if serial_number != expected_serial_number:
           print(f"Serial number mismatch: expected {expected_serial_number}, got {serial_number}")
           return False

       # Check the expiration date
       not_after = cert.not_valid_after
       current_time = datetime.utcnow()
       if not_after < current_time:
           print("Certificate has already expired.")
           return False
       elif not_after < current_time + timedelta(days=10):
           print("Certificate is expiring within 10 days.")
           return False
       else:
           print("Certificate is valid and not expiring within 10 days.")
           return True

   # Example usage
   hostname = 'your_server_name'
   port = 443
   expected_serial_number = 123456789  # Replace with the actual serial number

   check_certificate(hostname, port, expected_serial_number)
   ```

### **Explanation**

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - The `cryptography` library is used to parse and handle the SSL certificate.

2. **Connect to the Server**:
   - We create an SSL context and connect to the server using `socket.create_connection` and `context.wrap_socket`.

3. **Retrieve and Parse the Certificate**:
   - The certificate is retrieved in binary form and parsed using `x509.load_der_x509_certificate`.

4. **Check the Serial Number**:
   - The serial number of the certificate is compared with the expected serial number.

5. **Check the Expiration Date**:
   - The expiration date (`not_valid_after`) is checked to see if the certificate has already expired or is expiring within 10 days.

### **Benefits**

- **Security**: Ensures that the certificate matches the expected serial number and is not expired or expiring soon.
- **Automation**: Can be integrated into automated monitoring scripts to regularly check the status of SSL certificates.

This script should help you verify the SSL certificate's serial number and expiration status. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

To check multiple SSL certificates concurrently, you can use Python's `asyncio` library along with `aiohttp` for asynchronous network operations. This approach allows you to perform multiple network requests concurrently, improving the efficiency of your application.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have `aiohttp` and `cryptography` installed:

   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp cryptography
   ```

2. **Python Code to Check Multiple Certificates Concurrently**:

   ```python
   import asyncio
   import aiohttp
   import ssl
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from cryptography import x509
   from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

   async def fetch_certificate(session, hostname, port, expected_serial_number):
       context = ssl.create_default_context()
       context.check_hostname = False
       context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

       try:
           async with session.get(f'https://{hostname}:{port}', ssl=context) as response:
               cert_bin = response.connection.transport.get_extra_info('ssl_object').getpeercert(binary_form=True)
               cert = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert_bin, default_backend())

               # Check the serial number
               serial_number = cert.serial_number
               if serial_number != expected_serial_number:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Serial number mismatch: expected {expected_serial_number}, got {serial_number}")
                   return False

               # Check the expiration date
               not_after = cert.not_valid_after
               current_time = datetime.utcnow()
               if not_after < current_time:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate has already expired.")
                   return False
               elif not_after < current_time + timedelta(days=10):
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate is expiring within 10 days.")
                   return False
               else:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate is valid and not expiring within 10 days.")
                   return True
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"{hostname}: Failed to fetch certificate: {e}")
           return False

   async def main():
       # List of hostnames, ports, and expected serial numbers
       certificates = [
           {'hostname': 'example.com', 'port': 443, 'expected_serial_number': 123456789},
           {'hostname': 'anotherexample.com', 'port': 443, 'expected_serial_number': 987654321},
           # Add more certificates as needed
       ]

       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           tasks = [fetch_certificate(session, cert['hostname'], cert['port'], cert['expected_serial_number']) for cert in certificates]
           results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
           print("Results:", results)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
   ```

### **Explanation**

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - `aiohttp`: An asynchronous HTTP client for making network requests.
   - `cryptography`: Used to parse and handle SSL certificates.

2. **Asynchronous Function to Fetch Certificate**:
   - The `fetch_certificate` function uses `aiohttp` to make an asynchronous HTTP request to the server.
   - It retrieves the SSL certificate, checks the serial number, and verifies the expiration date.

3. **Main Function to Manage Concurrent Tasks**:
   - The `main` function creates a list of tasks for each certificate to be checked.
   - It uses `asyncio.gather` to run these tasks concurrently.

4. **Running the Asynchronous Tasks**:
   - The script runs the `main` function using `asyncio.run`.

### **Benefits**

- **Concurrency**: Allows multiple SSL certificates to be checked concurrently, improving efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a large number of certificates without blocking the main thread.

This approach ensures that your application can efficiently check multiple SSL certificates concurrently. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

To handle timeouts and retries for certificate checks in Python, you can use the `aiohttp` library along with the `tenacity` library for retry logic. This approach allows you to perform asynchronous network operations with robust error handling.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have `aiohttp` and `tenacity` installed:

   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp tenacity cryptography
   ```

2. **Python Code to Handle Timeouts and Retries**:

   ```python
   import asyncio
   import aiohttp
   import ssl
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from cryptography import x509
   from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
   from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

   @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
   async def fetch_certificate(session, hostname, port, expected_serial_number):
       context = ssl.create_default_context()
       context.check_hostname = False
       context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

       try:
           async with session.get(f'https://{hostname}:{port}', ssl=context, timeout=10) as response:
               cert_bin = response.connection.transport.get_extra_info('ssl_object').getpeercert(binary_form=True)
               cert = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert_bin, default_backend())

               # Check the serial number
               serial_number = cert.serial_number
               if serial_number != expected_serial_number:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Serial number mismatch: expected {expected_serial_number}, got {serial_number}")
                   return False

               # Check the expiration date
               not_after = cert.not_valid_after
               current_time = datetime.utcnow()
               if not_after < current_time:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate has already expired.")
                   return False
               elif not_after < current_time + timedelta(days=10):
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate is expiring within 10 days.")
                   return False
               else:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate is valid and not expiring within 10 days.")
                   return True
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"{hostname}: Failed to fetch certificate: {e}")
           raise

   async def main():
       # List of hostnames, ports, and expected serial numbers
       certificates = [
           {'hostname': 'example.com', 'port': 443, 'expected_serial_number': 123456789},
           {'hostname': 'anotherexample.com', 'port': 443, 'expected_serial_number': 987654321},
           # Add more certificates as needed
       ]

       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           tasks = [fetch_certificate(session, cert['hostname'], cert['port'], cert['expected_serial_number']) for cert in certificates]
           results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
           print("Results:", results)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
   ```

### **Explanation**

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - `aiohttp`: An asynchronous HTTP client for making network requests.
   - `tenacity`: A library for retrying operations with customizable retry logic.
   - `cryptography`: Used to parse and handle SSL certificates.

2. **Asynchronous Function with Retry Logic**:
   - The `fetch_certificate` function uses `aiohttp` to make an asynchronous HTTP request to the server.
   - The `@retry` decorator from `tenacity` is used to retry the function up to 3 times with exponential backoff (starting at 4 seconds and doubling each time, up to a maximum of 10 seconds).

3. **Timeout Handling**:
   - The `timeout` parameter in `aiohttp` ensures that the request will fail if it takes longer than 10 seconds.

4. **Main Function to Manage Concurrent Tasks**:
   - The `main` function creates a list of tasks for each certificate to be checked.
   - It uses `asyncio.gather` to run these tasks concurrently and handle any exceptions that occur.

### **Benefits**

- **Concurrency**: Allows multiple SSL certificates to be checked concurrently, improving efficiency.
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff, handling transient errors.
- **Timeout Handling**: Ensures that requests do not hang indefinitely, improving the robustness of your application.

This approach ensures that your application can efficiently check multiple SSL certificates concurrently while handling timeouts and retries¹²³. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

You can customize the retry logic using the `tenacity` library by adjusting parameters such as the maximum number of retries, wait times, and other retry behaviors. Here's how you can do it:

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Install the `tenacity` Library**:
   Ensure you have `tenacity` installed:

   ```bash
   pip install tenacity
   ```

2. **Customize Retry Logic**:
   You can customize the retry logic by setting parameters in the `@retry` decorator. Here are some common parameters you can customize:

   - `stop`: Defines when to stop retrying (e.g., after a certain number of attempts).
   - `wait`: Defines the wait strategy between retries (e.g., exponential backoff).
   - `retry`: Defines the conditions under which to retry (e.g., specific exceptions).

3. **Example Code**:

   ```python
   import asyncio
   import aiohttp
   import ssl
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from cryptography import x509
   from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
   from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential, wait_fixed, retry_if_exception_type

   # Custom retry logic
   @retry(
       stop=stop_after_attempt(5),  # Stop after 5 attempts
       wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=30),  # Exponential backoff with min 2s and max 30s
       retry=retry_if_exception_type(aiohttp.ClientError)  # Retry on aiohttp.ClientError
   )
   async def fetch_certificate(session, hostname, port, expected_serial_number):
       context = ssl.create_default_context()
       context.check_hostname = False
       context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

       try:
           async with session.get(f'https://{hostname}:{port}', ssl=context, timeout=10) as response:
               cert_bin = response.connection.transport.get_extra_info('ssl_object').getpeercert(binary_form=True)
               cert = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert_bin, default_backend())

               # Check the serial number
               serial_number = cert.serial_number
               if serial_number != expected_serial_number:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Serial number mismatch: expected {expected_serial_number}, got {serial_number}")
                   return False

               # Check the expiration date
               not_after = cert.not_valid_after
               current_time = datetime.utcnow()
               if not_after < current_time:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate has already expired.")
                   return False
               elif not_after < current_time + timedelta(days=10):
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate is expiring within 10 days.")
                   return False
               else:
                   print(f"{hostname}: Certificate is valid and not expiring within 10 days.")
                   return True
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"{hostname}: Failed to fetch certificate: {e}")
           raise

   async def main():
       # List of hostnames, ports, and expected serial numbers
       certificates = [
           {'hostname': 'example.com', 'port': 443, 'expected_serial_number': 123456789},
           {'hostname': 'anotherexample.com', 'port': 443, 'expected_serial_number': 987654321},
           # Add more certificates as needed
       ]

       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           tasks = [fetch_certificate(session, cert['hostname'], cert['port'], cert['expected_serial_number']) for cert in certificates]
           results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
           print("Results:", results)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
   ```

### **Explanation**

1. **Install `tenacity`**:
   - The `tenacity` library provides flexible retrying logic.

2. **Customize Retry Logic**:
   - `stop=stop_after_attempt(5)`: Stops retrying after 5 attempts.
   - `wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=30)`: Uses exponential backoff with a minimum wait time of 2 seconds and a maximum wait time of 30 seconds.
   - `retry=retry_if_exception_type(aiohttp.ClientError)`: Retries only on `aiohttp.ClientError`.

3. **Asynchronous Function with Custom Retry Logic**:
   - The `fetch_certificate` function is decorated with the customized `@retry` decorator to handle retries based on the specified logic.

4. **Main Function to Manage Concurrent Tasks**:
   - The `main` function creates a list of tasks for each certificate to be checked.
   - It uses `asyncio.gather` to run these tasks concurrently and handle any exceptions that occur.

### **Benefits**

- **Flexibility**: Allows you to customize retry behavior to suit your application's needs.
- **Robustness**: Ensures that transient errors are handled gracefully with retries.

This approach ensures that your application can efficiently check multiple SSL certificates concurrently while handling timeouts and retries with customized logic. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
