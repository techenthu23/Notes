# Ansible

In Ansible, **tasks** and **handlers** are fundamental concepts used to automate and manage configurations and deployments.

### Tasks
- **Tasks** are the basic units of action in Ansible playbooks. They define a single action to be performed on the managed nodes, such as installing a package, copying a file, or starting a service.
- Tasks are executed in the order they are defined in the playbook.
- Each task can include various modules, which are the actual units of work (e.g., `yum`, `apt`, `service`, `copy`).

Here's a simple example of a task that installs Apache:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
```

### Handlers
- **Handlers** are special types of tasks that are only run when notified by other tasks. They are typically used to perform actions that should only occur if a change is made, such as restarting a service after a configuration file is updated.
- Handlers are defined similarly to tasks but are placed in a separate `handlers` section.
- They are executed at the end of the playbook run, after all tasks have been completed.

Here's an example of a handler that restarts Apache:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    notify: Restart Apache

handlers:
  - name: Restart Apache
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```

In this example, the `Restart Apache` handler will only run if the `Install Apache` task makes a change (e.g., if Apache was not previously installed) ¹².

In Ansible, you can pass variables to tasks in several ways. Here are some common methods:

### 1. Defining Variables in the Playbook
You can define variables directly within your playbook using the `vars` section:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    my_var: "Hello, World!"
  tasks:
    - name: Print variable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ my_var }}"
```

### 2. Using Inventory Variables
Variables can be defined in the inventory file:

```ini
[webservers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1 my_var="Hello from inventory"
```

### 3. Passing Variables via the Command Line
You can pass variables when running the playbook using the `-e` or `--extra-vars` option:

```sh
ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml -e "my_var='Hello from command line'"
```

### 4. Using Variable Files
Variables can be stored in separate YAML files and included in the playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Print variable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ my_var }}"
```

`vars.yml`:

```yaml
my_var: "Hello from vars file"
```

### 5. Registering Variables
You can register the output of a task as a variable and use it in subsequent tasks:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Get date
      ansible.builtin.command: date
      register: date_output

    - name: Print date
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ date_output.stdout }}"
```

### 6. Using Role Defaults and Vars
When using roles, you can define default variables in `defaults/main.yml` and role-specific variables in `vars/main.yml`.

### 7. Including Variables in Tasks
You can also pass variables to included tasks:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include_tasks: my_tasks.yml
      vars:
        my_var: "Hello from included tasks"
```

`my_tasks.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Print variable
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "{{ my_var }}"
```

These methods allow you to manage and pass variables flexibly in Ansible¹².

Do you have a specific scenario in mind where you need to pass variables?

In Ansible, conditionals allow you to control the execution of tasks based on specific criteria. The most common way to use conditionals is with the `when` statement. Here are some examples to illustrate how you can use conditionals in Ansible tasks:

### Basic Conditional with `when`
You can use the `when` statement to run a task only if a certain condition is met. For example, you might want to install a package only if the operating system is CentOS:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install Apache on CentOS
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
```

### Using Variables in Conditionals
You can also use variables in your conditionals. For example, you might want to run a task only if a variable `my_var` is set to `true`:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Print a message if my_var is true
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "my_var is true"
    when: my_var
```

### Conditionals Based on Registered Variables
You can register the output of a task and use it in a conditional for a subsequent task:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Check if a file exists
    ansible.builtin.stat:
      path: /path/to/file
    register: file_stat

  - name: Print a message if the file exists
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "The file exists"
    when: file_stat.stat.exists
```

### Multiple Conditions
You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `and` and `or`:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Print a message if both conditions are true
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "Both conditions are true"
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat" and my_var
```

### Using `when` with Loops
You can also use conditionals within loops:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install packages only if they are not already installed
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
    loop:
      - httpd
      - nginx
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
```

### Conditional Imports and Includes
You can conditionally include or import tasks based on certain conditions:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Include tasks if a condition is met
    include_tasks: other_tasks.yml
    when: my_var
```

These examples demonstrate how you can use conditionals to make your Ansible playbooks more dynamic and responsive to different environments and situations¹².
