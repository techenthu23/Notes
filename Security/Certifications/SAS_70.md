# SAS 70 (Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70)

The **SAS 70 Type II certification** is an important indicator of quality for service providers. Here's what it entails:

1. **Well-Documented Procedures**:
   - Service providers must have well-documented procedures that support the delivery of their services.
   - These procedures are thoroughly scrutinized by independent auditors.

2. **Ongoing Compliance**:
   - Unlike a one-time audit, SAS 70 Type II certification ensures ongoing compliance.
   - Auditors assess controls not just once but continuously.

3. **Industry Standards**:
   - The certification originated under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
   - It evaluates controls related to data centers and other service organizations.

Remember, if you encounter a data center still listing a SAS 70 certification, it may be outdated. The industry now operates under the **SSAE 16** standard, which replaced SAS 70.

# Key differences between **SAS 70** and **SSAE 16**

1. **Framework**:
   - **SAS 70** (Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70) was an "auditing" standard.
   - **SSAE 16** (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16) is an "attestation" standard.

2. **Purpose**:
   - **SAS 70** focused primarily on financial reporting controls.
   - **SSAE 16** extends beyond financial controls to verify and assess controls related to compliance, operations, and other areas.

3. **Global Acceptance**:
   - **SAS 70** was widely accepted globally for reporting on controls at service organizations.
   - **SSAE 16** aligns with international standards (such as ISAE 3402) and aims for broader global acceptance.

In summary, **SSAE 16** replaced the aging **SAS 70**, offering a fresh approach to compliance reporting and reflecting the shift toward international accounting standards.

# Verifying Company Certification Status

To verify a company's certification status, you can use the following methods:

1. **UKAS CertCheck**:
   - **UKAS** (United Kingdom Accreditation Service) offers **CertCheck**, an online tool to verify the validity of claims of UKAS-accredited certification.
   - Commonly searched standards include ISO 9001 (Quality Management), ISO 14000 (Environmental Management), and ISO 45001 (Health and Safety Management).
   - You can search for certifications issued worldwide and track their accredited status¹.

2. **British Assessment Bureau**:
   - Visit the **British Assessment Bureau** website and use their "Verify Certification" feature.
   - Enter the company's trading name and certificate number to check the details of their certification, including the scope, date issued, and locations covered³.

3. **ISO Accelerator**:
   - **ISO Accelerator** provides an ISO certificate check tool.
   - Enter the certificate number (e.g., ISO 9001, 14001, or 27001) to verify its validity⁴.

Remember to use these tools to ensure the reliability of certifications.
