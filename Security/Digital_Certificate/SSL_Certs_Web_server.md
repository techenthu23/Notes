## When to Generate Certs for Apache HTTP and Self-Signed vs. Signed Certs

### When to Generate Certs

You should generate certificates for your Apache HTTP server when you want to:

* **Enable HTTPS:** This is essential for secure communication between your server and clients, protecting sensitive data like login credentials, credit card information, etc.
* **Establish trust:** A valid certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) builds trust with your users.
* **Comply with security standards:** Many industries and organizations have strict security requirements that mandate HTTPS and valid certificates.

### Self-Signed vs. Signed Certs

**Self-signed certificates** are generated by the server itself and are not signed by a trusted CA. They are suitable for:

* **Development and testing environments:** You can quickly set up HTTPS for testing purposes without the hassle of obtaining a signed certificate.
* **Internal networks:** If your website is only accessible within a private network, a self-signed certificate can be sufficient.

**Signed certificates** are issued by a trusted CA and are verified by browsers. They are essential for:

* **Production environments:** To ensure user trust and security, use a signed certificate for public-facing websites.
* **Compliance with security standards:** Many regulations require signed certificates.

**Important considerations:**

* **Browser warnings:** Browsers typically display warnings when accessing websites with self-signed certificates, as they cannot verify the identity of the server. This can deter users.
* **Certificate management:** Managing self-signed certificates can be more complex as you need to handle renewals and distribution manually.
* **Cost:** Signed certificates usually involve a cost, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through website hosting providers).

**In summary:**

* Use self-signed certificates for development, testing, or internal-only environments.
* Use signed certificates for production environments and when trust and security are paramount.

**Additional tips:**

* If you opt for a self-signed certificate, consider adding a certificate authority to your internal network for better trust management.
* Regularly renew your certificates to avoid interruptions.
* Implement HTTPS redirection to ensure all traffic is encrypted.

By carefully considering these factors, you can choose the appropriate certificate type for your Apache HTTP server and maintain optimal security.

## Certificates in Client Truststore: Self-Signed vs. Signed Certs

### Understanding the Context

Before we dive into the specifics, it's crucial to clarify the context:

* **Client:** Is this a web browser, a custom application, or something else?
* **Server:** Is it an Apache HTTPd server using a self-signed or signed certificate?
* **Purpose:** What is the goal of storing certificates in the client truststore? Is it for authentication, authorization, or simply to avoid certificate warnings?

### General Considerations

Regardless of the specific scenario, the client truststore generally holds certificates that the client trusts for verifying the identity of servers. These certificates are typically issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs).

### Specific Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Self-Signed Certificate on Server

* **CA Certificate:** Since it's a self-signed certificate, there's no intermediate or root CA involved.
* **Server Certificate:** In this case, you'd likely import the **server's certificate** into the client truststore to avoid certificate warnings. However, this is generally not recommended for production environments due to security implications.

#### Scenario 2: Signed Certificate on Server

* **CA Certificates:** In this case, you typically need to import the **intermediate and root CA certificates** into the client truststore. These certificates form the trust chain that validates the server's certificate.

### Additional Notes

* **Browser Trust Stores:** Most modern browsers come with pre-installed trust stores containing certificates from well-known CAs. This is why you usually don't need to manually import certificates for websites using signed certificates from trusted CAs.
* **Custom Applications:** If you're building a custom application, you'll have more control over the trust store. You can import necessary certificates based on your application's requirements.
* **Certificate Formats:** Certificates can be in various formats (PEM, DER, JKS, etc.). Ensure compatibility with the client trust store.

**Example:**

If you're building a Java application that communicates with an Apache HTTPd server using a signed certificate, you would typically import the intermediate and root CA certificates into the Java truststore (usually `cacerts`). This allows the application to verify the server's identity and establish a secure connection.

On Redhat

In RHEL, the consolidated system-wide truststore is located in the `/etc/pki/ca-trust/` and `/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/` directories. The trust settings in `/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/` are processed with lower priority than settings in /etc/pki/ca-trust/.

Certificate files are treated depending on the subdirectory they are installed to:

* Trust anchors belong to

`/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/` or
`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`.

* Distrusted certificates are stored in

/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/blocklist/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/blocklist/.

* Certificates in the extended BEGIN TRUSTED file format are located in

/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ or
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/.
Note
In a hierarchical cryptographic system, a trust anchor is an authoritative entity that other parties consider trustworthy. In the X.509 architecture, a root certificate is a trust anchor from which a chain of trust is derived. To enable chain validation, the trusting party must have access to the trust anchor first.
