Ransomware attacks are growing at an alarming rate. According to Harvard Business Review, ransomware attacks were up 150% in 2020, and ransoms paid by victims increased by
more than 300%.
A recent Gartner report, ___Detect, Protect, Recover: How Modern Backup Applications Can Protect You From Ransomware___, noted that _“By 2025, at least 75% of IT organizations will face one or more attacks.”_

In the battle against ransomware, traditional approaches to security and data protection are failing.
- __Perimeter security is not enough to keep ransomware out__. Despite massive investments in perimeter, endpoint, and application-layer defenses, attackers continue to gain access to valuable business data.
- __Traditional backups are vulnerable__. While backups are the last—and most important— line of defense against ransomware, sophisticated attackers know this too. Many ransomware attacks target backups to prevent recovery and force payment. Traditional backup methods are great for recovering from natural disasters and operational failures, but they were not built to
withstand cyber threats and are therefore vulnerable.

In the face of these grim realities, IT teams are turning to Zero Trust methods to protect against ransomware and other cyber threats.  Zero Trust architecture assumes all users, devices, and applications are untrustworthy and can be compromised. 

When it comes to protecting backup data, Zero Trust Data Security relies on six distinct capabilities

1) The first line of defense in Zero Trust is preventing attackers from gaining access to data in the first place. There are multiple methods to reduce unauthorized access:

   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Least privileged access

2) The next line of defense is to protect your backup data to the greatest extent possible—even if ransomware gains access. Again, there are multiple methods that should be employed:
   - Encryption
   - Immutability

    By combining encryption and immutability, you can ensure that even if ransomware gains access to your data, it can neither render your backups unreadable nor exfiltrate data that compromises your company, your employees, or your customers.
