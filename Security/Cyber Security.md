# AIC traid

The AIC triad is a framework in information security that focuses on three key principles to ensure the protection of information and systems:

1. Availability: Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. This involves implementing measures to prevent downtime, disruptions, and ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance.


2. Integrity: Maintains the accuracy and trustworthiness of information by protecting it from unauthorized alteration. This includes safeguarding data consistency during storage, transmission, or processing.


3. Confidentiality: Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure. It involves implementing access controls, encryption, and other privacy-preserving techniques.



This triad is a foundational concept in cybersecurity, ensuring that systems and data are secure, reliable, and private. It complements the more widely known CIA triad, which focuses on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Some organizations emphasize AIC to stress the importance of Availability as the top priority, especially in critical infrastructure systems.
