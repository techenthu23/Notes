In the context of U.S. Federal Reserve supervision, MRIAs (Matters Requiring Immediate Attention) and MRAs (Matters Requiring Attention) are formal supervisory findings issued to banking organizations to address identified weaknesses.

Matters Requiring Immediate Attention (MRIAs): These are critical issues that pose significant risks to a bank's safety and soundness or indicate substantial noncompliance with laws and regulations. Banks are expected to address MRIAs promptly and effectively. 

Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs): These findings highlight important concerns that, while not immediately threatening the bank's stability, require timely corrective action to prevent potential deterioration. 

The Federal Reserve uses these supervisory tools to ensure that banks maintain robust risk management practices and comply with applicable regulations. Failure to address MRIAs or MRAs can lead to more severe enforcement actions. 

It's important to note that while Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a critical aspect of information security, the term "DLP MRIA" is not commonly used in Federal Reserve communications. Therefore, if you encounter "DLP MRIA" in a specific context, it would be advisable to consult the relevant documentation or reach out to the issuing authority for clarification.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other regulatory bodies, enforces various guidelines, recommendations, and mandatory requirements for banks and financial institutions to ensure stability, security, and compliance. These are categorized based on the severity of the issue and its impact:


---

1. Guidelines and Recommendations

These are best practices aimed at improving a bank's operations and risk management but are not legally binding.

Supervisory Letters (SR Letters): Provide general guidance on risk management, compliance, and governance practices.
Example: SR 20-15 on "Operational Resilience in Cybersecurity."

Policy Statements: Encourage institutions to adopt recommended practices.
Example: Guidance on climate-related financial risk management.

Industry Best Practices: Suggested by organizations like the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).
Example: Business Continuity Planning recommendations.



---

2. Mandatory Requirements

These are legal obligations that must be complied with to avoid enforcement actions, penalties, or restrictions.

Regulations and Laws

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA): Requires banks to safeguard sensitive information and provide privacy notices to customers.
Example: Implementation of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems.

Bank Secrecy Act (BSA): Focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT).

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): Ensures accuracy in financial reporting.

Dodd-Frank Act: Focuses on consumer protection, financial stability, and systemic risk.


Supervisory Findings

Matters Requiring Immediate Attention (MRIAs): Critical issues that must be addressed urgently due to significant risks or regulatory non-compliance.

Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs): Important concerns that require timely corrective actions but do not pose immediate threats.


Reporting Requirements

Submission of periodic reports such as Call Reports or Capital Adequacy Reports to ensure regulatory oversight.


Cybersecurity Standards

Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA): Mandates cybersecurity measures for financial institutions.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Guidelines: Often referenced in regulatory frameworks, e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
