Monitoring broken symbolic links on a Linux platform can be done using a combination of find, cron, and log analysis tools. Here’s how you can achieve it:


---

1. Detecting Broken Symlinks

You can use the find command to identify broken symbolic links in a directory:

find /path/to/search -xtype l

-xtype l: Finds broken symbolic links.


To log broken links with timestamps:

find /path/to/search -xtype l -printf "%T+ %p\n" >> /var/log/broken_symlinks.log


---

2. Automating Monitoring with a Cron Job

You can schedule a cron job to run the command at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes):

crontab -e

Add the following line:

*/5 * * * * find /path/to/search -xtype l -printf "%T+ %p\n" >> /var/log/broken_symlinks.log

This logs broken symlinks with timestamps every 5 minutes.


---

3. Counting Frequency of Occurrence

To count how many times broken symlinks appear over time:

awk '{print $1}' /var/log/broken_symlinks.log | sort | uniq -c

This will group entries by date and show frequency.


---

4. Alerting When Broken Links Appear

If you want to trigger an alert (e.g., email or Slack notification):

Using Email

Install mailutils (if not already installed):

sudo apt-get install mailutils

Modify the cron job:

*/5 * * * * find /path/to/search -xtype l -printf "%T+ %p\n" | tee -a /var/log/broken_symlinks.log | mail -s "Broken Symlinks Alert" your@email.com

Using System Logging (syslog)

You can log broken symlink events to /var/log/syslog:

find /path/to/search -xtype l | while read link; do
    logger -p warning "Broken symlink detected: $link"
done


---

5. Visualizing with Grafana + Prometheus (Optional)

If you want an advanced monitoring setup:

1. Use node_exporter with a custom script to track broken symlinks.


2. Push data to Prometheus.


3. Create alerts and dashboards in Grafana.




---

Conclusion

Basic approach: find + cron + log analysis.

Alerting: Use mail, syslog, or a monitoring tool.

Advanced monitoring: Use Prometheus + Grafana.

Service Principal Name (SPN) – What It Is & Use Cases

What is an SPN?

A Service Principal Name (SPN) is a unique identifier for a service instance in a network, primarily used in Kerberos authentication. It allows clients to authenticate to a service using Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) without needing to provide credentials repeatedly.

SPNs are associated with Active Directory (AD) accounts and help in Single Sign-On (SSO) by mapping a service to a specific user or machine account.

Use Cases of SPN

1. Kerberos Authentication – Used for SSO in enterprise environments.


2. Delegation – Allows a service to act on behalf of a user.


3. Mutual Authentication – Ensures both client and server trust each other.


4. Database Authentication – Used for SQL Server to authenticate clients via Active Directory.


5. Web Services (HTTP/HTTPS) – Enables secure authentication for web applications.




---

Setting Up SPN for Different Services

1. SPN for a Database (SQL Server)

Why?

Allows Windows clients to authenticate against a SQL Server instance using Kerberos authentication instead of NTLM.

How to Register SPN for SQL Server?

1. Determine the service account running SQL Server:

Get-WmiObject Win32_Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "MSSQL*" }


2. Register SPN for SQL Server:

setspn -S MSSQLSvc/hostname:port DOMAIN\SQLServiceAccount

MSSQLSvc → Service class for SQL Server.

hostname → FQDN of the SQL Server.

port → SQL Server port (default is 1433).

DOMAIN\SQLServiceAccount → The account running SQL Server.



3. Verify SPN Registration:

setspn -L DOMAIN\SQLServiceAccount


4. Check Authentication Mode: Run the following SQL query:

SELECT auth_scheme FROM sys.dm_exec_connections WHERE session_id = @@SPID;

KERBEROS → SPN is working.

NTLM → SPN is not working correctly.





---

2. SPN for an HTTP/HTTPS Web Application

Why?

Enables Kerberos authentication for web applications, allowing users to access services without entering passwords.

How to Register SPN for HTTP Service?

1. Determine the service account running the web application (IIS, Apache, Nginx).


2. Register the SPN:

setspn -S HTTP/webserver.domain.com DOMAIN\WebServiceAccount

HTTP → Service class for web services.

webserver.domain.com → FQDN of the web server.

DOMAIN\WebServiceAccount → The account running the web service.



3. For IIS (Windows Server)

Ensure Kernel-mode authentication is enabled.

In IIS Manager, under Authentication, select Windows Authentication.

Use ApplicationPoolIdentity mapped to the service account.



4. For Apache/Nginx (Linux)

Ensure Kerberos module (mod_auth_kerb) is installed and configured.

Update the Apache configuration:

AuthType Kerberos
AuthName "Kerberos Login"
KrbAuthRealms DOMAIN.COM
KrbServiceName HTTP/webserver.domain.com
Krb5KeyTab /etc/httpd/conf/krb5.keytab
Require valid-user



5. Verify SPN Registration

setspn -L DOMAIN\WebServiceAccount




---

Common Troubleshooting

SPN Duplicate Error:

setspn -X

If duplicates exist, remove them:

setspn -D SPN_NAME ACCOUNT

Kerberos Authentication Not Working?

Ensure SPN is registered under the correct account.

Use KLIST to verify the Kerberos ticket:

klist tickets

Ensure the service account has "Trust for Delegation" enabled in AD.




---

Conclusion

SPNs are crucial for Kerberos authentication in enterprise networks, ensuring secure, passwordless authentication for databases and web services. Proper SPN setup is key to achieving SSO and mutual authentication across applications.
